If you are one of those couples, then you might try searching the Internet for sites that offer information on wedding planners or browsing the yellow pages for the services of wedding planners.",
            "The process of listing down and cutting down everything into specific details\u2014the wedding date, the venue, the reception, the caterer, the designer of the gown and suit, all the way down to the wedding coverage\u2014are the areas wedding planner ushers in.",
            "A dependable wedding planner will take of the event on full or partial-service in terms of planning the big day. Most wedding planners offer its clientele conventional yet exceptional ideas and design to match the person or couple's personality.

This scheduled appointment is quite beneficial because the couple is given time to arrange their schedule and devote the time they have chosen to discuss their dream wedding details. Once the appointment is set, the wedding planner will gather a little information about what is to be discussed and get some suggestions from the couple so the firm can prepare packages and other offers for the client.",
            "Although planners help a lot in the entire wedding planning process, they might not cover everything needed for the event.

            "Have you ever had an uncontrollable urge to be pierced by a dozen needles? This is the image most people get when someone mentions the word \u201cacupuncture\u201d. It comes as no surprise that most view this technique with suspicion, even downright horror. The fact is, however, that this relatively painless ancient Chinese technique has helped relieve the symptoms of millions of people. Properly used, it can help in the management of many medical conditions including chronic pain and fatigue.",
            "How does needle puncture work?",
            "Practitioners of Chinese traditional medicine believe in energy flows. This energy, called Qi, circulates around the body using pathways called meridians. Meridians run very close to the surface of the skin in certain areas and can be accessed by needles. Much like plumbing, these pipes can get blocked or go the wrong way, causing health problems. The insertion of needles at these points is aimed to help loosen blocks and normalize flow.",
            "It sounds like a made-up explanation with no basis in reality, but there are numerous scientific studies which support the effects of acupuncture. Although the exact scientific basis is still unknown, recent theories seem to suggest involvement of complicated neurochemical effects in the brain, nerve to spinal cord impulse modulation, and microscopic connective tissue changes.",
            "What risks and side effects are of concern?",
            "The use of things not completely understood for the treatment of medical conditions is nothing new. Penicillin and aspirin were used for decades solely on the basis of their beneficial effects, without doctors knowing exactly how they worked. Results are what are truly important. However, it is equally important is to ensure that the technique is used safely.",
            "Like other strategies used in treating health conditions, acupuncture may have some side effects. Medications have side effects and allergic reactions, surgeries have risk of infection and complications. For needle puncture, there is a risk of injury, rare infections, minor bleeding, small bruises, and some dizziness.",
            "You can minimize the possible side effects by choosing a licensed acupuncturist. Most countries either have government licensing in place or have professional organizations with very strict rules and regulations.",
            "How do treatments go?",
            "An acupuncturist will do an initial evaluation of your medical history and your body\u2019s current state. Multiple pressure points are palpated, and a regimen of treatment is formulated. Most courses involve a series of 10 to 20 treatment sessions, each lasting 30 to 90 minutes. Needles will be carefully placed at the required points and kept in place for some time. Most patients report a feeling of mild sensation at the site of the puncture, but no real pain.",
            "Right after each acupuncture session, you will feel a bit tired and may need to rest. Some people feel an increase in their energy levels. The response to acupuncture is very individual. In some cases there is immediate relief of symptoms. For some patients, the beneficial effects may only be noticed after undergoing a few sessions. Do not be alarmed and keep your acupuncturist updated on what you are feeling to ensure everything is going as expected.",
            "You need never fear the thought of needles ever again. Acupuncture is a beneficial treatment with a long history of effectiveness. It is used to complement current medical therapy and should not replace currently existing medications or treatments.",
            "The safe application of this once exclusively Chinese therapy can now be experienced by chronic disease sufferers worldwide."

            "Using needles to adjust bodily functions to optimum levels is the principle behind acupuncture. Both ancient Chinese and modern Western practitioners have used this technique to relieve many sufferers of chronic disease. Needling is a relatively safe, beneficial treatment strategy that can be used to reduce pain, improve healing, and increase general well-being. But exactly how is this procedure done and what sort of benefits can be obtained?",
            "Procedure for Needle Puncture",
            "There are two broad categories of acupuncture practice today, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and medical acupuncture. Both have their merits, so the choice is individual. The decision for most people hinges upon which philosophy appeals more to them and which technique holds the least apprehension.",
            "In TCM, practitioners adhere to the concept of Qi, or energy flow, and the meridians in which they travel. They use longer needles and insert them deeper in order to reach the acupuncture points. Modern science has found little evidence to prove the existence of these energy channels, but this is the technique that has been used effectively for thousands of years.",
            "In medical acupuncture, the practitioners are graduates of western medical schools. Their application of needles is not based on the traditional acupuncture points, but on anatomic data. These acupuncturists use shorter needles and the insertions are shallower. They also tend to use fewer needles and leave them inserted for shorter periods of time. Adherents to TCM feel this is a watered-down version of the real thing. Nevertheless, many patients have felt relief of symptoms through this method.",
            "Conditions for Puncture Application",
            "There is a broad and extensive list of ailments which can be treated with acupuncture. The conditions run the gamut from asthma to constipation, anxiety to weight loss. Most TCM practitioners believe that any health condition results from an imbalance in Qi flow, therefore amenable to needle therapy. Western acupuncturists tend to have a more limited list of indications, the most common of which is undoubtedly control of pain.",
            "Control of pain is the most well researched of all of the indications for acupuncture. There is a definite beneficial effect for a majority of patients using this method. Migraines, premenstrual syndrome, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and neuralgias are but a few examples. The theory behind its effectiveness is also medically accepted and well researched, called the gate-control theory of pain. It states that the needles can stimulate nerves so that they block the impulses from pain triggers.",
            "Expected Puncture Session Result",
            "It is important to emphasize that acupuncture is used only on top of existing medical therapy. At no time should a patient discontinue medication or ignore medical instructions in favor of needle puncture. After undergoing a needle puncture regimen, the primary care physician can make an evaluation with regards to decreasing dependence on other therapies.",
            "A course of acupuncture therapy will last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. This depends upon the complexity of the particular medical condition. Results also vary, so it is important to have a frank discussion with the acupuncturist regarding expected results and their time frame. In general, the patient will begin to feel beneficial effects after three or four session. Certain specific conditions will actually get a little worse before improving so keeping informed is key.",
            "In modern medicine, the use of traditional techniques with proven results has become a widely accepted practice. Acupuncture has proven its worth time and again. Modern practice guidelines make it effective, reproducible, and safe. It is a gift of healing form ancient sages that has the potential to bring relief to millions of people."

            "Acupuncture is a holistic approach in treating and preventing certain diseases. Its main tool are very thin needles that are inserted to targeted points in the body. The body has about 400 of them linked through a system known as meridians or pathways. Once these are stimulated, these are supposed to create balance in the body.",
            "Autism on the other hand is a brain disorder that is long term. This disease is characterized by deficits in language, social communication and cognition. Children who are diagnosed with this illness may also suffer from secondary problems such as aggression, irritability, stereotypes, hyperactivity, negativism, volatile emotions, temper tantrums, short attention span and obsessive-compulsive behavior.",
            "Preliminary studies have shown that acupuncture may provide symptomatic relief to children suffering from autism. Although difficult at first, it is believed that it is rewarding in the long run. This is because while conventional therapy and treatment requires that the child stay still, acupuncture doesn\u2019t. Some say it\u2019s a quick prick at the vital points in the body.",
            "A group of children in the US participated in a test to see how effective acupuncture is among children. There are 22 respondents and each of them was given the treatment once every other day for four months.",
            "After the treatment 20 out of the 22 respondents showed remarkable improvement. In fact 2 of them has cerebral blood flow.  The only thing that did not change prior to treatment and after was the blood flow between the left and right cerebrum as it showed no differences.",
            "Aside from traditional acupuncture to help children with autism, a preliminary study in Hong Kong is trying to see if tongue acupuncture can produce better results.",
            "Results have showed that of 30 respondents in the test, majority showed functional improvement of various degrees depending on the age and severity of their disabilities. Some improvement was noticeable within a few TAC sessions, especially for drooling, spasticity (scissoring or tiptoeing), ataxia, and poor balance in walking. Functional improvement was noted after one to two courses of TAC. Most children tolerated TAC well, with only occasional pain and minor bleeding in some patients.",
            "The reason why tongue acupuncture is being experimented with is because there is a connection between the tongue and the heart through the meridians that spread to all the organs in the body. It is believed that the points on the tongue can influence the state of the other body organs thus giving relief to the one suffering from autism.",
            "But many believe that acupuncture alone cannot help autism sufferers. It has to be combined with other things like maintaining a certain diet to help improve one\u2019s mood and communication schools. Although it is only short term, it is better than nothing until a cure is found.",
            "When will the cure be found? Only time can tell as there are many other questions that have to be answered in order for doctors to further understand neurological disabilities. Doctors who are conducting research believe that an interdisciplinary approach is needed given that acupuncture has shown positive results in helping children with autism."

Unlike the cartoon where the balloon will pop and all the air will go out, the needles that are inserted into the vital points will stimulate the body to release endorphins thus helping the person control their appetite.",

The patient will have to come back for regular treatment and have to pay attention to one\u2019s diet and exercise regularly as needles can only do so much to control one\u2019s weight.",

            "Smoking is one hard habit to break. If nicotine patches and gum doesn\u2019t work, perhaps you should try something else like an alternative form of healthcare like acupuncture.",
            "Acupuncture is an ancient practice involving the use of needles. This instrument is inserted into the skin to allow you energy or Qi to start flowing freely around your body and thus help you quit smoking.",
            "When you go visit an acupuncturist for the first time and tell him or her that you want to quit smoking, after answering some questions, the specialist will carry out an examination of your ears and search for areas where the energy is low.",
            "Once these spots are identified, these sharp needles are then inserted. Usually 5 needles are placed in various acupoints.",
            "The treatment is finished after an hour and when the needles are removed, you are advised to wear ear magnets so your session continues even when you leave the clinic.  While acupuncture itself is a painless procedure, some smokers have claimed that they felt a prick or get sleepy.",
            "Most smokers will have to come to the clinic 4 to 6 times before seeing any significant results.  Just to give you an idea, one study shows that the respondents reported a decrease in the number of cravings to smoke just after one or two sessions. Seven out of 10 of the respondents were able to kick the habit after 5 or 6 sessions.",
            "Because the number of test subjects is small, there are some who doubt the effectiveness of acupuncture.  This is because although there are positive signs with regards to the short term effects of this technique, its effects were not sustained. This is why some medical journals have stated that it is unclear what acupuncture can do in smoking cessation.",
            "But you have to remember that acupuncture is not permanent. It merely starts something that you have to finish on your own. Some smokers who go 2 or 3 times a week to the clinic will need to come back for follow up sessions in the future.",
            "At the same time, you have to find ways to prevent yourself from picking up a cigarette. You can do this by staying away from people who smoke since you will be tempted to ask for a stick. You can create your own personal mantra which you repeat to yourself every time you have an urge.",
            "Remember that this craving is only short term and will last only for a few minutes. You have worked so hard to leave this behind so stick to the path and stay smoke free.",
            "Acupuncture treatment for smokers should only be done by a license professional. You can do some research online to find out if they are accredited by the National Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, ask how long they have been in the profession, find out how many smokers they have helped and how much will they charge.",
            "Once you have found one, you have to commit yourself to the program because both you and the acupuncturist have to work together to give up this habit.",
            "Acupuncture can help smokers in the same way that it has helped addicts and alcoholics quit their addictions. You just have to try it even if you may not believe in it."

        "summary": "",
        "content": [
            "The foundation of acupuncture rests on the relevance of an individual\u2019s chi in maintaining bodily and mental health. It is believed that chi is present in every living creature, and flows through specific pathways in the body. Health problems arise when the flow of chi on the body is blocked. As a result, a person may feel persistent headaches, muscle pain, fever, weakness, or in the worst case, becomes afflicted with more serious health conditions.",
            "A Deeper Explanation of Acupuncture",
            "Acupuncture has its origins in ancient Chinese philosophy and practice. More than ten thousand years ago, during the Old Stone Age of China, stones were fashioned into knives for medical purposes. After several years, during the New Stone Age, these stones were eventually made into needles intended for the same therapeutic end. These accounts are further evidenced by unearthed stone needles found to be of the same types used during the New Stone Age.",
            "There are basically 14 pathways throughout the body where chi flows continuously. These are called the meridian points. In order for chi to course through the body unobstructed, there has to be a balance between the strengths of yin and yang. In ancient Chinese philosophy, yin and yang represent the forces of the universe- yin is for feminine, while yang is for masculine. Every single thing in the universe is believed to contain both yin and yang for harmony.",
            "When the yin and yang are not balanced, chi cannot stream through the body liberally. Therefore, the meridian points through which chi courses through need to be stimulated. This is done by the insertion of hair-thin, disposable needles in specific areas on a person\u2019s body to induce bodily harmony and bring about healing.",
            "A certified and trained acupuncturist will be able to carry out an excellent therapy session for the patient. Trainings for acupuncturists are given in order for them to obtain their licenses. A poor practitioner may not be proficient enough with the practice and could end up jeopardizing the results of the entire procedure. Nowadays, it is wise to verify on a practitioner\u2019s credentials to ensure a safe and effective acupuncture treatment.",
            "What This Ancient Method Does",
            "One of the foremost effects of acupuncture on the body is relaxation. Stress is frequently pinpointed as the main precursor for a host of physical ailments. There are particular points all over the body that direct the flow of harmony and relaxation and when these are enthused, the patient becomes more at ease.",
            "Another positive effect of this alternative therapy is increased pain control. During a session, a patient will usually feel very minimal pain as the thin needles are being inserted gradually. However, the needles are deliberately placed in varying depths, depending on the health requirements of the patient. When the needles reach the right depth, the patient will feel deeper pain, although the entire procedure is not necessarily painful.",
            "It is also recommended for relief from chemotherapy fatigue as well as chemotherapy-related nausea. It has also been found to be largely effective for back pains, migraines, menstrual cramps, and as a pain controller for patients after undergoing surgical operations.",
            "Variations of Conventional Acupuncture",
            "Auriculotherapy or ear acupuncture is one of the variations of conventional acupuncture. In this practice, it is believed that the ear provides a map for all the major bodily organs. A specific area or point on the ear corresponds to a particular organ, such as the heart, kidneys, or liver. Thus, the needles are placed in particular points around the ear and on the ear cartilage.",
            "Staplepuncture is a method used in smoking cessation, wherein staples are placed for a certain period anywhere on the ear area to provide stimulation.",
            "Indeed there is growing evidence that this traditional Oriental practice can rival any modern forms of treatment. If you are one of the many people who are looking for a widely recognized and time honored therapeutic practice, acupuncture may just be the alternative treatment for you."

        "content": [
            "Today's world can fill the very busy individual with a lot of stress. Without some way of removing this stress from your system, you're placing yourself in danger from a lot of stress-related diseases. You might suffer from insomnia or headaches or very serious heart diseases.",
            "You could take anti-stress pills to help you relax but, like me, you might also be worried about the side effects these pills could have. The good news is that you could try acupuncture at least once to see if it could help you manage the stress. It certainly couldn't hurt to try acupuncture if all you're after is stress relief.",
            "If you find it doesn't work for you, then you can just easily stop taking acupuncture treatments. If it works, though, then you can say you've found a good treatment for stress that doesn't rely on those dangerous chemicals and pills.",
            "How does sticking needles into your body help manage the stress?",
            "In traditional Chinese medicine, much of the treatments depend on an understanding of the balance in our bodies and its internal organs. The sicknesses we sometimes develop are seen to be caused by imbalances in our lifestyles and environment. Stress is also affected by this imbalance. That is why when there is something wrong with your body, you'd typically have less of an ability to deal with stress. You'd get more irritable and find it really to difficult to relax.",
            "By sticking these very thin needles past the surface of our skin, the acupuncturist stimulates nerves in our body. These nerves send signals to our brain and scientists believe that the brain then releases its natural painkillers into our system. This immediately causes a feeling of relaxation for many people.",
            "The needles could also help your body by stimulating its circulation. With the circulation between the organs of the body improved, a lot of the body's wastes could be cleansed properly. Your organs would also receive the full benefit of the oxygen from your lungs making its way into the cells of your body without any blockages. This makes your organs much healthier and leaves you feeling much better in the long term as well.",
            "You can think of a session with the acupuncturist as very much like massage therapy. A good massage would help give you a very relaxing sleep that night and an acupuncturist could help you with your sleep as well. You might immediately start to feel drowsy as soon as the right nerves are stimulated by the acupuncturist's needles.",
            "You might be asking yourself how you'd be able to relax if you're suffering from the pain of the needles attached to your body. What you might not realize is that because of the thinness of the needles, you would hardly feel anything. The most that many people claim they feel is a kind of tingling feeling where the needles are. And that is actually a sign that the process is working,",
            "Acupuncture is a practice that helps you use your bodies' own ability to manage stress properly. This leaves you healthier, and more importantly, prevents any of the serious diseases that could come from unbalanced, stressful lifestyles.",
            "It might not be something to replace regular trips to the doctor but with its many possible benefits, acupuncture might be worth trying out very soon."

            "Students who enroll in such courses will be taught through demonstration, discussion and hands on application.",
            "Part of the curriculum will also include basic courses in traditional medicine covering subjects such as anatomy, biosciences, medical terminology, herbal medicine, moxibustion, and acupressure. In some schools, they may require students to also learn about nutrition and various kinds of research.",

            "It doesn\u2019t matter if you are still in high school or if you are already working because a shift in your career could let you achieve your true calling.",
            "The best way to start though is to talk with an acupuncturist about what it takes to become one so he or she will be able to give you an idea of what happens in the job.",

            "We mentioned that you have to study in a school certified by the Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM). One more hurdle you have to face before getting your license is passing an exam given by them except in the state of California which has its own regulating body and board certification exam in order for you to practice your profession.",
            "An acupuncturist degree is just the first step in becoming your own boss. To become a master, you have to learn everything there is to know as a student so those who entrust themselves to you in the future will not have any problems.",
            "As more people are opening their minds to this practice, people should know that getting an acupuncture degree will not replace traditional medicine since there are limits to what it can do for the patient. It is merely a form of holistic healthcare that works hand in hand with science to help the person deal with an illness."

            "If, like me, you have quite a fear of needles and injections, then acupuncture, that practice of sticking needles onto different parts of your body to cure sicknesses might seem scary at first.",
            "However, if you've been long been suffering from some problems like headaches or chronic pains and your regular visits to the doctor don't seem to be helping you, then why not consider a trip to an acupuncture specialist? After all, who hasn't heard of somebody's aunt somewhere suffering from arthritis and trying out everything that the doctors recommended all to no avail, only to finally be cured by a really good acupuncturist?",
            "Perhaps you were wondering if it could actually work for you. You might feel a bit skeptical since traditional Chinese medicine doesn't immediately coincide with theories in modern Western medicine. In fact, the use of needles to cure people was discovered thousands of years ago in China long before microscopes or x-ray machines were invented or before bacteria and germs were discovered.",
            "When you think about it, that might be something that the practice has going for it. If it has existed already for thousands of years and is still being practiced by millions up to now, then it must have worked already for quite a number of people.",
            "What typically happens when you go to an acupuncturist?",
            "When you go to an acupuncturist, you would typically first be asked about your medical history, how you're feeling and any symptoms of sicknesses you might have. The specialist would observe features of your face, including your tongue. According to specialists, your tongue is a good indicator of the health of your internal organs. The acupuncturist would listen to sounds that your body makes like the sounds coming from your lungs. How your body smells could also be an indicator of your overall health for the acupuncturist's diagnosis.",
            "Based on what the acupuncturist finds out about your sickness, he or she would then formulate the treatment that your body needs. With traditional Chinese medicine, sicknesses are seen as a kind of imbalance and loss of harmony between your bodies' organs. You can consider the use of needles on your body as just a way to push your body and its organs back into balance.",
            "The specialist would begin inserting very thin needles into the right places in your body. To many people, inserting these needles doesn't really hurt. After all, an acupuncturist's needles are usually much thinner than the needles that are used for injections. Many have claimed that inserting these needles actually calms them down and relaxes them.",
            "How does the use of these needles help you?",
            "A lot of problems have been claimed to have been alleviated through this practice. These include headaches, the common cold, arthritis, back pains, asthma and even infertility.",
            "Even though acupuncture isn't part of Western medicine, Western medicine experts have studied it extensively. Some theories as to why it works involve acupuncture perhaps stimulating the brain's release of the body's natural painkillers. Acupuncture could also stimulate proper circulation in the human body.",
            "Western medicine is still studying acupuncture and trying to find out how to best integrate it with practices in Western medicine. That is why, along with Western medicine and trips to the doctor, one could certainly try acupuncture.",

            "In a generation when physical fitness is given topmost attention, people are always on the lookout for the newest and most effective means for weight loss. Acupuncture, the method of inserting thin, filiform needles on certain points in an individual\u2019s body, has been found to be one effectual method for losing weight.",
            "Not many people may find the idea of being inserted by needles quite comforting in their quest for weight control. However, this ancient Chinese alternative treatment seeks to deliver a control mechanism, enabling the patient to manage hunger cravings more successfully in the long run.",
            "The Skinny on Acupuncture Weight Loss",
            "It has been found that weight gain is directly related to emotions.  Other than physical hunger, people reach for a huge chocolate bar or a big platter of burger and fries because of the sense of comfort derived from food and eating. More often than not, excessive weight gain is an emotional issue, rather than a mere physical one. You may not realize it, but you tend to take in more food whenever you\u2019re stressed, upset, or pressured.",
            "In Acupuncture, there are specific spots on the body being targeted by the hair-like needles. These spots are linked to certain areas in the body and by stimulating these spots; the patient will achieve a greater sense of inner balance. As these points are inserted by the needles, certain hormones are released throughout the body. These substances work by helping you manage hunger and efficiently control the impulse to overeat.",
            "How Acupuncture Induces Weight Loss",
            "Most acupuncturists will target the spots behind the ear when it comes to promoting weight loss. When these points behind the ear are stimulated, endorphins are released in large doses. Endorphins are called the feel-good hormones, and these are also often referred to as natural pain and fever relievers. The release of endorphins is what makes you feel better after an increased level of physical activity, as in the case of a good workout.",
            "These bodily compounds allow the patient to experience better relaxation, thus considerably alleviating stress. There is a greater possibility of enhanced weight loss when the patient has already achieved emotional wellness. Endorphins are also released whenever the body experiences low levels of bodily pain, thus their moniker as a natural pain reliever.",
            "Patients of acupuncture typically experience very minimal or no pain at all, however most of the points are located near nerve endings and muscle tissues. As the needles are embedded in the body, signals are sent to the brain thus promoting the release of endorphins from the pituitary gland.",
            "There are also other points in the body that serve as gateways for better weight management. One of these placements promotes a decrease in an individual\u2019s appetite, while another has the ability to reduce water retention in the body. The acupuncturist may choose a multi-targeted approach, depending on the requirements of the patient.",
            "Consulting with a Professional Acupuncturist",
            "There are a number of acupuncture practitioners in existence nowadays, offering a host of services. If you are considering this form treatment for your weight management, make sure that you settle with no less than a trained and professional acupuncturist. A poorly trained acupuncturist may not be able to pinpoint the specific meridian points and worse, may cause unnecessary bodily pain and discomfort.",
            "Moreover, your acupuncturist may require an herbal supplement for your treatment, to encourage a longer-term effect. Your sessions need not be maintained for an extensive period; however you may be required to visit your acupuncturist during the entire course of the sessions.",
            "There are other means for losing weight successfully, and this does not include crash dieting and strenuous work outs. If carried out by trained professionals, acupuncture can be the answer for effective weight management. While it is far from being a cure-all, it may just be the right weight loss solution for you."

        "title": "Eight Myths About Acupuncture",
        "summary": "",
        "content": [
            "There are a lot of myths with regards to acupuncture. Some of these are true; others are silly while the rest only have a half truth. As you read on, you will learn which ones are worth believing.",
            "The first myth is that acupuncture is painful. This is not true because those who have tried it claimed they only experienced a tiny prick while others did not feel anything at all. There is no tissue damage when the needle is inserted into the skin or pulled out and only in very rare cases are there traces of bruising.",
            "The second myth is that you can get hepatitis or AIDS from acupuncture. This is true only if the needles used are not sterilized. In the US, this will never happen because acupuncturists are required to use disposable needles thus you are not at risk from these two diseases.",
            "Third, acupuncture is used to treat pain. This is only a half truth because this holistic technique has been proven to do other things such as stop a person\u2019s addiction, lose weight and prevent certain illnesses.",
            "Fourth, there are some who think that Asians are the only ones that can practice acupuncture. Since 1982, there are already 50 schools all across the country that teach students about this technique and become licensed acupuncturists.",
            "This means that anyone who has the desire to learn about this ancient practice can do so and help treat patients. Just to give you an idea, there are at least 3,000 acupuncturists now working in the US.",
            "Fifth, medical doctors do not believe in the potential of alternative medicine. This is not true because there are more doctors these days that are open to the idea that there are other ways to help patients aside from conventional medicine. In fact, some of them even recommend an acupuncturist if they know that what they have done is not effective.",
            "Another myth is that every patient will undergo the four needle technique. This is not true and it will only be used when the specialist feels that the energy of the patient is virtually not moving as a last resort.",
            "The seventh myth is that it is better for a medical doctor to perform acupuncture. This is wrong because the training is much different than that taught in medical school. Students who have an acupuncturist license train for 3,000 hours before they are allowed to practice this profession. So between an acupuncturist and a medical doctor, you should go with someone who has learned about this much longer.",
            "The eighth myth is that acupuncture is only used in third world countries. This is not true because this technique originated in China more than 2000 years ago and this has spread to developed nations in Asia such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.",
            "Here at home, acupuncture been practiced for more than 2 decades and is legal in 30 states. In fact 22 of them, license professionals after they graduate once they pass the state board examination.",
            "Although acupuncture has been around for a very long time, there is still a need for this form of holistic healthcare which is why this is being taught in colleges and in use today. It is painless and cost efficient and a lot of studies have shown that it is effective in treating various illnesses and preventing some of them."

            "Looking beautiful both inside and out is something we all want to achieve. Since your face is ridden with emotion and hormonal issues, you have to take care of it.

            "Facial acupuncture treatment needs to be done twice a week for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. For those who can\u2019t make two sessions in a week, they can opt for the 1 treatment that will last 90 minutes.",
            "After the regular sessions, it is advisable to go back for follow up treatment. It should be every 2 weeks for the next 2 months and then once a month later on.",
            "Aside from needles, most clinics use herbs in the form of masks, poultices and moisturizers. Before you use it, check with your doctor to make sure there is no allergic reaction to any forms of medication that you are taking.",
            "After the first facial acupuncture treatment, you will usually seen an increased glow to one\u2019s complexion which the Chinese say an increased Qi or blood flow to the face. It becomes more open, the wrinkles start to disappear and the skin appears more toned.",

            "The end result is that you will look and feel 5 to 15 years younger but of course this depends on how well the patient has taken care of themselves outside the confines of the clinic.",
            "To sum things up, facial acupuncture can do for you. It can eliminate fine lines and reduces wrinkles, improve your overall facial color and add luster to the skin, relaxes tension in the face and furrows in the brow, brightens the eyes and reduce dark circles and puffiness, improve muscle tone for sagging skin, enhance your natural radiance in the skin and eyes, slow the aging process within, promotes overall health and well being as well as relaxes and revitalizes the entire body.",

            "You should now that the 50 schools mentioned are all accredited by the National Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.  It is recognized by the Department of Education and some of these schools even have a masters program.",
            "Most of these schools can be found online so you can give them a call and ask certain questions about the school. You can find out the cost of tuition, the teacher student ratio, if the school offers consultation services to students and the alumni and if they have an extensive library which focuses on traditional Chinese medicine.",
            "Should there be a school near where you live, you should probably take it so you don\u2019t have to worry about boarding and lodging as this is just added cost to this long term investment.",
            "If you like the school but cannot afford the cost of tuition, find out if they offer scholarships or if they have a grant in aid program. If there are none, then check with the federal government because they should have one and they will give it to deserving students who plan to enroll in a school accredited by the National Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.",
            "Some states do not require you to get a license once you graduate from the program. However, if you plan to practice this elsewhere, you should prepare yourself for the state board exam as this is a requirement.",
            "The lists of subjects you will be learning in school include anatomy, body therapy, massage therapy and the other sciences. Training will be done also in a clinical setting so you are able to put theory into practice but this will only happen in your third year.",
            "While some schools will let you finish a program in three years, there are those that can be completed after five.",
            "Lately, acupuncture school has also gone down the digital path by offering cyber distance programs for those who cannot go to school. Some of these offer CEU\u2019s or continuing education units to advance programs.",
            "These courses can be chosen on the basis of modules or on an hourly basis. The course material covers the history, theory and techniques of acupuncture. Courses that offer tools such as acupuncture DVD and video are ideal for acupuncturists or students of acupuncture to improve their clinical expertise.",
            "Once you graduate from acupuncture school, some will open their own practice while others will first work for a clinic. Those who decide to be employed will work with other professionals that may include naturopaths, chiropractors and other specialists that are also into Oriental Medicine.",
            "The average acupuncturist makes about $45,000 a year but this can change in the years to follow as they add years or experience under their belt. This just goes to show that if you work hard, you too will make a fortune. Just make sure that you do this properly for each patient because one mistake could make this all go away."

        "summary": "",
        "content": [
            "With the growing acceptance of alternative medicine in Western cultures, acupuncture is quickly becoming a popular practice. More and more people today are choosing acupuncture over western medicine to treat bodily pains, relieve stress, or to promote overall health. If you are thinking about trying acupuncture but are wondering if it is safe or if it\u2019s the right treatment for you, the following information may aid you in making a more informed decision.",
            "Description and Origin",
            "Acupuncture is the practice of inserting fine needles into specific points in the body for therapeutic purposes. According to theory, these specific points called \u201cacupuncture points\u201d lie along pathways of the body along which one\u2019s vital energy is said to flow. The needles are used to promote free-flow of energy in areas of the body that circulation may have stagnated. Although acupuncture is practiced in many Asian cultures such as Japan, Tibet, and Korea the practice is commonly known to have originated in China.",
            "Acupuncture in the Western World",
            "One of the most debated issues between the East and the West is the use of acupuncture as a western means of medical treatment. Even though this form of medicine has been used as an effective method for over five thousand years in China, there is no concrete evidence from scientific research studies that have proven the healing properties of acupuncture.",
            "Skeptics shrug off the positive effects of acupuncture as merely placebo effects. Believers in acupuncture, however, say that the benefits have simply not yet been proven. Believers promote that the treatment is harmless and can be used as a complement to western medicine.",
            "Unfortunately, standards of acupuncture have not been fully approved by the FDA due to many unregulated practices that still exist such as the re-use of needles. Furthermore, acupuncture certification today is mostly a sham, used to make money on desperate patients who have not benefited from western medical treatments. The National Council Against Health Fraud has even declared acupuncture as an unproven means of treatment whose concepts of healing are primitive and false.",
            "Should You Try It",
            "One thing that Western science can agree upon is that there are no proven harmful effects of acupuncture. Many doctors agree that as long as a medication is not detrimental to one's health, then there is no reason why it should not be used if there are noticeable benefits. Most scientists would also state that it is simply due to a lack of research that the therapeutic properties of acupuncture have not yet been proven.",
            "Although many forms Chinese medication remain debated concepts in Western society, there is a growing interest in these medications and perhaps as the acceptance of the practice grows, so will the discoveries about its medical properties.",
            "More Information on Acupuncture",
            "You can find more information about acupuncture at an acupuncture center close to you. You can easily locate nearby centers or practitioners by searching online. An appointment may be necessary as acupuncture centers are usually busy with long wait lists.",
            "So if western medicine is not working for you and you are looking for an alternative, give some thought acupuncture. More and more people are discovering the therapeutic benefits of this ancient medicine. Acupuncture is safe and harmless, and therefore you have nothing to lose and everything to gain."

        "summary": "",
        "content": [
            "Acupuncture is already a renowned method used in treating smoking addiction. An alternative medicine believed to have originated as far as 3000 BC in ancient China, this treatment is now being widely utilized for various medicinal and therapeutic purposes. It has been found furthermore to successfully treat drug dependence and chronic smoking addiction.",
            "There are several smoking cessation medications and therapies available presently. However acupuncture is a recommended alternative procedure, especially where conventional therapies have already failed. The strategic insertion of needles in various parts of the body aims to treat the condition in a more profound and emotional level. A smoker needs to free himself from the physiological and psychological addiction of smoking, thus necessitating a more holistic treatment.",
            "How It Stops the Addiction",
            "The placement of needles is usually located behind the ear, or on the ear cartilage. This is where the calming effect takes place, curbing the patient\u2019s cravings for more cigarettes. People who have a smoking habit are bound to take up the nicotine stick more often whenever they feel stressed, bored, or depressed. Needles are also often inserted on the hand and wrists to promote a steadier flow of bodily energy. The feeling of relaxation will help an individual think twice about lighting a cigarette again.",
            "Furthermore, this treatment has been found to help an individual deal with the withdrawal symptoms better.  This alternative medicine promotes better tolerance to pain and discomfort during smoking cessation. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild to severe and may involve nausea, palpitations, and dizziness. Oftentimes, these same conditions will propel an individual back to his smoking tendencies sooner than later.",
            "Nicotine is the addictive and toxic substance present in a cigarette. This is the same substance that makes quitting a big challenge for most smokers. The nicotine that you get from smoking will attach itself to the pleasure areas in the brain, making it hard for you to stop. Without a steady stream of this substance, a smoker will tend to feel depressed and uncomfortable.",
            "People who have undergone acupuncture treatment reported that they no longer find cigarettes as tempting or as satisfying. Oftentimes, smoking would leave an awful taste in their mouths prompting them to stop their habit for once. Some patients would even resort to eating mints or lozenges to clear to get rid of the terrible aftertaste.",
            "According to skilled practitioners, approximately 7 out of 10 smokers will successfully extricate themselves from their smoking habit after 2 or 3 weeks. While the others are unable to quit totally, these smokers will be able to cut down on their cigarette consumption quite significantly.",
            "Treatment from Acupuncture Experts",
            "It is very essential for a patient to consult with a skilled acupuncturist. A more personalized service will be provided by an expert, as well as added counseling for the patient. Moreover, an acupuncturist may prescribe herbal supplements to aid the patient in quitting efforts.",
            "During treatment, filiform needles are inserted into specific points on the ear cartilage, as well as the hands and wrists. Normal procedures last for about 30 minutes. Body acupuncture can be used in combination with the ear and wrist needle placements. An acupuncturist may also utilize a mild electric current, to enhance the effect of the needles through the body.",
            "The greatest advantage of this ancient Oriental procedure is the absence of side-effects during and after treatment. Unlike smoking cessation medications and nicotine replacement therapy products, acupuncture does not employ chemically manufactured substances. There is also no risk of weight gain during therapy. In conjunction with helping a patient quit smoking, it can also curb appetite, thus reducing food cravings.",
            "If you have tried several methods in smoking cessation to no avail, perhaps it is high time you consider the alternative method that is acupuncture. With the right practitioner and the right frame of mind, there is no reason why you won\u2019t be nicotine-free before long."

            "First, you should not eat a large meal before or after treatment.",
            "You should also avoid over exercising, engaging in a sexual activity or consume alcoholic beverages 6 hours before and after treatment.",
            "Since the acupuncture session will last from 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on how often you have to go to the clinic, you better fix your schedule so you have time to rest.",
            "Chances are, you were consulting with a doctor prior to your visit to the acupuncturist. If there are any prescription medicines given, don\u2019t forget to take them.",
            "You will not feel any improvement after just one or two visits with the acupuncturist. Just the same, you should write this down so you can go back to the acupuncturist on your next visit and tell him or her how you felt during the previous session. Such feedback will let the specialist know what needs to be modified in the future to help you with your problem.",
            "The acupuncturist might give you some herbs to take as part of your treatment. Since you don\u2019t know if taking them will have any side effects with the medication you are taking, you should first consult with your doctor if it is safe to consume both.",
            "Women who are pregnant are also advised not to undergo acupuncture treatment. However, they can engage in that once the baby is born.",
            "How well the acupuncture treatment will go depends also on specialist who will be performing it. You have to take into account their years of experience and skill so they are able to make the correct diagnosis, finding the acupoints in the body, the angle at which the needles will be inserted and the techniques they know as there are different types of acupuncture.",
            "This brings us to asking ourselves how to find a skill acupuncturist. For this to work, we have to do ask our doctor if they can refer anyone. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to also do some research online. After all, there are about 3,000 acupuncturists all across the country so it won\u2019t be that hard to find one.",
            "Before you decide to have a session with them, talk to the acupuncturist to know their credentials. This will also give you the opportunity to find out how much do they charge as this can be from $45 to more than $100 per session.",
            "You can probably ask for the name and contact number of a previous client so you can ask this person how everything went. Remember, if it doesn\u2019t work out for you, don\u2019t be afraid to find someone else who can do a better job.",
            "The most important thing to do during the session is to relax. If you feel an itch or something, tell the acupuncturist. The same goes if you are nervous or experience a burning sensation so the specialist will take out the needles.",
            "Now that you know the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of acupuncture, you should ask yourself if this form of treatment is right for you. If conventional medication doesn\u2019t work, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to see how things turn out."

            "Whenever you are feeling pain and discomfort, you'd usually reach for your painkillers for relief. While they do relieve the pain, they also bring along side effects that comes with taking foreign chemicals into your body. As much as modern medicine has developed drugs that can relieve pain right off the bat, do you really think that the quick fixes you've been taking are actually good for your body? Why not try something safer and more effective like acupuncture.",
            "What is acupuncture?",
            "Acupuncture has surged in popularity for the last few decades as brought on by the recent health trend. Mostly known as a traditonal Chinese medical technique, acupuncture is seen as a homeopathic method of treatment. While alternative medicine does raise a lot of eyebrows for the scientifically-inclined, it does merit attention before being dismissed as a quack cure.",
            "Basic Procedure",
            "Basically, needles are inserted into the skin, each corresponding to one of the numerous pressure points located throughout the body. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, by inserting a needle into the pressure point, an acupuncturist can manipulate the flow of chi or life force, thus relieving pain and gradually treating the patient. While most would say that the whole chi thing is a bunch of nonsense, science has suggested that with the needles inserted, the body's natural painkillers called endorphins are released, thus helping with pain relief.",
            "Instruments",
            "Modern acupuncturists nowadays use disposable fine stainless steel needles that are 0.007 to 0.020 inches in diameter which are sterilized with either ethylene oxide or by autoclave. Since they are way finer than hypodermic syringe needles, being poked by these needles are relatively painless. The upper third of the needle is covered with either a thicker bronze wire or plastic to make the needle sturdier and easier to handle. The length of the needle and how far they are inserted is all up to the acupuncturist and his practised style of acupuncture.",
            "Example Of Treatment",
            "If a patient has a headache, he/she is diagnosed and is treated by stimulating the sensitive points located at the webs between the thumbs and palms. In acupuncture theory, these points are connected to the face and head and can be used for treatment of headaches and other ailments involved. Needles are then carefully inserted into the skin until the patient feels a twinge, which is usually accompanied by a slight involuntary twitching of the area. During this treatment, a number of things may occur.",
            "- Sensitivity to pain in where needles are inserted.",
            "- A hint of nausea during treatment in case of bad headaches.",
            "- Near-immediate headache relief.",
            "Evolution",
            "As an ancient method, acupuncture has crossed over into the modern age with implementations of technology and recent scientific findings. Electrical stimulation is now a common technique that is combined with acupuncture to produce more effective results. Also, acupuncturists combined this eastern technique with western methods to further enhance the treatment.",
            "Practitioners have eventually realized that leaning towards one school of thought can't propagate progress unless they are willing to move towards the future by looking towards other horizons as well.",
            "Reactions And Research",
            "Not everyone is impressed with acupuncture itself. Most western medical professionals have expressed either doubt or indifference to the oriental method while others have downright driven it down into the earth with criticisms and brutal skepticism. However, recent research shows the efficacy (or lack thereof) of acupuncture, and while more research has to be done, it has been proven to actually positively affect some, but not all, forms of ailments that it claims to cure.",
            "So as the doors open to a new age of acupuncture, give it a try when you feel the need for pain relief and you will not be disappointed. As the Chinese have used it for many centuries, so should we."

            "Acupuncture comes from two Latin words namely \u201cacus\u201d which means needle in English and \u201cpungere\u201d which means prick. Its history originated in China more than 2000 years ago and has evolved into various forms.",
            "Some of the techniques of acupuncture do not even use needles anymore. Vibrating objects, ultrasound and even the fingers of the practitioner have taken some of the work to make the person feel better.",
            "The history of acupuncture is first discussed in an ancient Chinese medical text called the \"Huang Di Nei Jing\" or The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine.",
            "But there have been a few who are skeptic as archaeologists have found a 5,000 year old mummy in the Alps with similar acupuncture points in the body. This gives some people the idea that it was used even before the Chinese did but sine there is no written text to prove that, no one is certain and credit to this ancient practice goes back to the Chinese.",
            "In the 6th century, this knowledge moved to Japan. In the 17th century, a man by the name of Waichi Sugiyama wanted to make this procedure painless for the patient so he developed the insertion tube, a small cylindrical tube through which the needle is inserted. Believe it or not, this technique is still being used today.",
            "But acupuncture only reached the US in the early 80\u2019s with the establishment of a regulatory board called the National Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. As a result, various schools have been built and those who want to become licensed acupuncturists are now able to practice their profession.",
            "Despite that, there were a lot of people who are not yet convinced on the positive effects of alternative forms of medication. It was only in 1995 that the US Food and Drug Administration decided to classify the needles used for acupuncture as medical instruments and assured the public that they are both safe and effective.",
            "To further promote acupuncture, the NIH or National Institute of Health in 1997 has stated that this technique is very useful in treating various health conditions.  These include ear, nose, throat, respiratory, gastrointestinal, eye, nervous system and muscular disorders. In some cases, acupuncture is able to prevent some of them from happening.",
            "This was further strengthened by the fact that the side effects of acupuncture are much less than that of conventional drugs that are being sold by pharmaceutical companies.",
            "So that people can avail of acupuncture, another recommendation by the NIH is for US companies to provide full coverage for certain conditions. If you do not quality, perhaps there is partial coverage which you should look up in your policy.",
            "But despite that, more research needs to be done to see its effects on other health related problems. Some examples of these include addictions, autism, chronic low back pain, migraines and osteoarthritis of the knee.",
            "If you look at the history of acupuncture, not much has changed since the needle technique used back then is still being used today. Even if various forms have developed through the years, one thing for sure is that it works.",
            "In order for you to see how effective it is, you have to see a specialist who is not only qualified to treat your condition but also one is well trained."

            "Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine that has been practiced for thousands of years.

            "Pain",
            "Acupuncture is most commonly known to treat bodily pains such as muscular pains and arthritis. There are many types of arthritis, and each have a different acupuncture procedure.

Acupuncture is thought to relieve stress and improve flow of energy that may be causing the depressive symptoms. Improvement in symptoms can be seen as early as the first session. Experts have found acupuncture to be a beneficial complement to other forms of depression therapy such as psychological counseling, and healthier than chemical alternatives such as anti-depressants.",

            "Acupuncture has become a popular alternative to common remedies such as sleeping pills. It works at the nerve levels, relaxing and soothing your senses. Acupuncture is thought to be a safer route for insomnia because it brings back your natural sleeping cycle through natural means and not through chemicals, which can turn into an addiction. Using acupuncture for insomnia usually starts working after the very first session. The treatment is usually stretched out for a period of time, until your body returns to its natural sleeping cycle.",
            "Infertility",
            "Studies show that acupuncture is a beneficial form of complementary therapy for women who are having undergoing treatments for fertility problem. Acupuncture is believed to relieve the anxiety of women undergoing fertility treatment. Also, acupuncture's success in aiding fertility is more pronounced in in-vitro fertilization. In addition, the rate of miscarriages has been found to be lower for women who do acupuncture.",
            "Others",
            "The following are other ailments that acupuncture has been known to remedy:",
            "\u00b7 Menopausal problems such as hot flushes, infertility, and premenstrual tension.",

            "Acupuncture has been practiced for hundreds of years. To let you know more about this practice, here are a few things that you should know.",
            "First, acupuncture is a holistic healthcare technique that involves inserting needles into specific points in the body. Studies have been conducted and it has been proven to treat ear, nose, throat, respiratory, gastrointestinal, eye, nervous system and muscular disorders.",
            "The needles used in acupuncture are very small and you will probably feel a slight twitch when the needle goes in. They will be inserted carefully to \u00bc or an inch in depth and will stay there from 45 minutes to an hour depending on the condition of the patient.",
            "If inserted properly, you should feel some cramping, distention, electric sensation or tingling which means that the treatment is working.",
            "Needles used for acupuncture especially in the US are clean because they are required to be disposable. This prevents any chance that those who go for treatment will be contaminated by a communicable disease like hepatitis or HIV.",
            "Given that this has been practiced for more than 2000 years, various styles of acupuncture have been developed. So, before you decide to go for a session, you should know what technique is used so they can explain to you what happens.",
            "When looking for an acupuncturist, you should also ask where they got their training, how long they have been in the practice and most importantly, what experience the specialist has had in treating the condition you are experiencing.",
            "They should also be able to present their credentials like where they graduated and their state board license. If you live in a state that does not require a license, make sure they have something to show which certifies that they can practice their profession like a document from the National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncturists.",
            "The duration of your treatment varies depending on the nature of your problem. Some are easy to fix compared to others especially if you are dealing with something long term. For instance, alcoholics and drug users may quit their vices after 3 or 4 months while those suffering from a disease like autism will take years as there is no know cure yet for the this illness.",
            "Before the needles are inserted, you need to undergo a physical examination and answer a few questions. There are risks involved even though it is a painless procedure because the needle might hit something vital inside but if the specialist is good, then there is nothing to worry about.",
            "You may notice a spot of blood when the needles come off. But if you are concerned about it, talk to your acupuncturist so he or she can prescribe something.",
            "Some patients will experience immediate relief after the first session but others will not experience anything at all. This is the reason that an average session should be done 12 to 15 times at least 2 to 3 times a week.",
            "If acupuncture works for you, then the only thing you need are follow up sessions. This can be done twice every 2 weeks or monthly. It is really up to you. But don\u2019t forget to also see your regular doctor so he or she can also monitor the progress of your condition."

        "content": [
            "There are different types of acupuncture. Whichever you decide to use, they are designed to do the same thing and that is to relieve pain or treat certain diseases.",
            "The first is called TCM based acupuncture. Here, it uses eight principles of complementary opposites to create harmony in the body. These include yin/yang, internal/external, excess/deficiency, hot/cold.",
            "Next is called French energetic acupuncture. This is often used by MD acupuncturists. Meridian patterns are emphasized here particularly the yin-yang pairs of primary meridians.",
            "Korean hand acupuncture is another as practitioners believe that the hands and feet have concentrations of qi, and that applying acupuncture needles to these areas is effective for the entire body.",
            "There is also auricular acupuncture where it is believed that the ear is a microcosm of the body. This means that acupuncture needles are placed on certain points on the ear so it can treat certain addiction disorders.",
            "Myofascially-based acupuncture is often utilized by physical therapists as it involves feeling the meridian lines in search of tender points before applying needles as this is where abnormal energy flows.",
            "Japanese styles of acupuncture referred to as \"meridian therapy,\" tend to put more emphasis on needling technique and feeling meridians in diagnosis.",
            "Impulses of electromagnetic energy can also be used as the body generates tiny but electrical discharges which influence the function, growth and maturity of certain types of cells. By inserting the needles in these areas, it stimulates and alters the neurotransmitters in the body thus making the patient feel better after treatment. This is also sometimes used for diagnosis and testing.",
            "There are also other forms of acupuncture that do not use needles. For instance there is sonopuncture that uses an ultrasound device that transmits sound waves to points in the body to treat a patient. Some practitioners use a tuning fork or other vibration devices.",
            "Acupressure is another. Here, the professional will use their hands to relieve the pain. This can be used on it sown or with other manual healing techniques.",
            "The number of treatments you will need depends on the patient\u2019s condition. On average this could be from 10 to 5 treatments and 2 to 3 times a week. How much it will cost also varies as this could be from $40 to $150. Some insurance companies and HMO\u2019s now cover that or partially so you should check if this is included in your policy.",
            "Anyone can try acupuncture to relieve pain or prevent one but many practitioners decline to see someone during pregnancy. But if you have already started, it is generally safe to do so until the infant is born.",
            "Some acupuncturists may ask you to take in some herbs as part of the treatment. Since you have no idea what it can do, have this checked first by your local doctor to make sure this is safe as this could interact with the drugs you are taking causing side effects.",
            "Which type of acupuncture should you try? That is up to you. All of them are effective so discuss this with your doctor and do some research so you know what you are getting yourself into. Each of these is painless so just relax and let the professional do the rest.",
            "Just like conventional medicine, don\u2019t expect an improvement overnight as this takes time so just keep an open mind."

            "The acupuncturist is the specialist who conducts acupuncture. He or she may use needles or some other instruments depending on the type that will be used to create harmony and balance in the body.",
            "Before this person does anything, you will first have to answer a few questions. You will then be given a physical exam to check your pulse and observe the shape, color and coating of your tongue. Other things that are checked will be the color and texture of the skin and your posture as this will give clues to your health.",
            "Only then will you be told to lie down on a padded examining table and the needles are inserted to the skin. The difference with this kind of needle is that they twirl and jiggle each time they are pushed further into the body.",
            "You may not feel them at all and if you do, it will only be a twitch that soon goes away. Once they are in place, this will be left there for 15 to 60 minutes that may make you feel very relaxed and sleepy that you may even doze off. Once the session is complete, the needles are removed and you will be on your way.",
            "In some cases, acupuncture is more effective when the needles are first heated. This technique is known as \u201cmoxibustion.\u201d Here, the acupuncturist lights a small bunch of the dried herb called moxa or mugwort and holds it above the needles. The herb, which burns slowly and gives off a little smoke and a pleasant, incense-like smell, will never directly touch your body.",
            "Another variation is electrical acupuncture. Here, electrical wires are hooked up to the needles and a weak current runs through it which may cause no or little sensation at all.",
            "It is also possible that herbal medications will also be prescribed by the acupuncturist for your treatment to be successful.",
            "When looking for an acupuncturist, make sure that person is licensed. Before he or she can obtain one, they have to complete 4 years of training at an approved college of oriental medicine. In the state of California, one governing body that gives the person the title is the California Acupuncture Committee.",
            "If they get this from another organization, a copy of their license must always be clearly displayed in the practitioner\u2019s office. One example is the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.",
            "When choosing an acupuncturist, there are a few things you should ask aside from their credentials. You should know what styles of acupuncture is used as there are some techniques that do not use needles to treat a patient.",
            "Although there are no studies which prove that one technique is better than the other, some patients are more comfortable with one type over the other.",
            "Another question you should ask and discuss further is the length of the treatment. Patients who are suffering from a chronic illness will have to be treated over a period of months before any improvements can be seen. This will help you plan your schedule since you need to go to the clinic 2 to 3 times weekly.",
            "The acupuncturist just like a medical doctor is there to help you get better. If you don\u2019t see any progress with this person, perhaps you should seek the help of another specialist."

            "The earliest account of this is found in the book called Nei Jing which in English means the Yellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal Medicine. The contents of this book date somewhere around 200 BC. Back then, they did not use metal needles and instead used those made out of stone, moxibustion and herbs to treat a patient.",
            "Acupuncture prevents and treats diseases by inserting very fine needles into the skin specifically at the anatomic points of the body.",
            "The principle behind this concept is that illnesses occur because there is an imbalance in your life force otherwise known as Qi. It is believed that this flows in 14 channels in the human body known as meridians which branch out to bodily organs and functions. If there is a blockage or obstruction in any of them, this is when you succumb to a disease or an illness.",
            "The imbalance in the Qi may go one way or the other because of Yin and Yang. The person can only be normal if there is harmony between the two which is what acupuncture is trying to achieve. This can only be restored by stimulating these acupuncture points so your Qi can be adjusted, balanced and harmonized.",
            "Apart from using needles, practitioners also use friction, heat, impulses of electromagnetic energy and pressure to stimulate these points in order to balance the movement of energy in the body to reduce one\u2019s health.",
            "An example of this is sonopuncture where an ultrasound device that transmits sound waves is applied to these points in the body. Some use a tuning fork and other vibration devices.",

By inserting the needles in these areas, it stimulates and alters the neurotransmitters in the body thus making the patient feel better after treatment. This is also sometimes used for diagnosis and testing.",
            "According to the World Health Organization or WHO, here is a list of some illnesses where acupuncture is used. These include acute bronchitis, the common cold, cataract, toothaches, gingivitis, hiccups, ulcers, constipation, diarrhea, headache and migraine, Meniere\u2019s disease, osteoarthritis and a lot more. In the US, acupuncture is often used to treat chronic pain conditions and mind body disorders.",
            "But acupuncture is not risk free. Hematoma may develop if the needle punctures a circulatory structure. It is also possible that pneumothorax may occur if the needle is inserted too deep. There is also the risk of HIV and hepatitis if the needle was not properly sterilized.",
            "Now that you know what acupuncture is, you must not forget that it is merely an alternative and not a proper form of medical treatment. This means you should still be examined by a professional in the medical field who can determine the severity of your illness or disease."

Sometimes a child will be placed in a home, and then the child will be taken out of the home for various reasons. If you are thinking about adoption dissolution is because of an adoption that was more difficult then expected. Often adopting parents find out that they are unable to care for the child or have problems with the child. Sometimes a family does not mess well when there are current siblings and adopted siblings.",

Often you can get help with therapy, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t seem like anything helps to relieve the situation adoption dissolution is brought up. Most of the time the children are not bad, but there are medical or health issues that need to be dealt with but the adoption family is unable to give them the attention needed. Keep in mind that adoption dissolution is not always the answer to some of the family problems, but it is also not something that you should be ashamed about. All situations are different, but you\u2019ll find that adoption dissolution can work for some people.",

This is not a simple decision, as agencies provide many support services to ease the process, but they can also be costly. Plus, it raises even more questions: Where can I find an agency near me? How do I know if the agency is reputable? Do I choose a public or private agency? This article aims to answer some of these questions, or at least aide in finding the answers.",
            "First of all, there are two types of adoption agencies-- public and private. A public agency is run by the government (either state or regional) and supported by public monies. These agencies generally assist in the adoption of foster care youth. Private adoptions agencies, on the other hand are run by a private entity. They are licensed by the state in which they operate, but are funded privately. These agencies can be of assistance in all types of adoptions.",
            "A major advantage of using an adoption agency is that they do all of the \"searching\" for you. They will do the work of finding and matching a child to you, based on specified criteria. Support options are also generally available through adoption agencies, especially private ones. These services include counseling, referrals, and both pre- and post-adoption education. The downside to all of this is, of course, cost. It is estimated that an adoption can cost from $5,000 to $40,000.",
            "Adoption costs money, there's no doubt about that. However, when beginning the adoption process, you may encounter certain costs which should raise red flags. For instance, beware of any agency which requires payment of fees immediately after application. There will usually be a small fee up front, but otherwise proceed with caution. Do not deal with any agency that feels or has been reported to be disreputable.",
            "That being said, ask about costs upfront. There may be a sliding scale, and there are resources that exist to defray the costs of the adoption process.",
            "Another factor to consider is any specific focus which you would like the agency to take. Some agencies, for example, specialize only in placing bi-racial children, while others focus solely on children with special needs. Be sure to ask about any such emphasis before choosing an agency.",
            "Of course, before you can begin doing all of this, you must locate an agency in your area. Adoption.com maintains an online directory of adoption agencies across the United States, as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom. Here you can browse the clickable map, or search by state, category and agency name. There is also the option of selecting a country to adopt from internationally. The directory is available online at http://directory.adoption.com.",
            "This, of course, only answers a few of the myriad questions that people face when deciding to adopt. Prospective adoptive parents are encouraged to do as much research and ask as many questions as possible before beginning the adoption process. It can be a tedium of red tape, but in the end it is worth the struggle, and knowing the length of the struggle beforehand can make it that much easier."

I know your thinking, what is an adoption announcement?  Well I will tell you.  An adoption announcement is a lit like a birth announcement, but instead of saying something like, we are welcoming the birth of our child, it will say something like, we are welcoming into our family.",
            "There are all sorts of different kinds of adoption announcements.  Some people make their own announcements.  They say it is easier to make announcements than it is to find adoption announcements for older children.  Some people buy adoption announcements that contain pictures or have ribbon and bows.  Some have both.  Adoption announcements come in different languages.  They can include the name of the child, the child's birth date, where the child is from, such as what country, the day you met the child and the date the adoption was final.  They usually have the adoptive parent's names on it and any siblings.  The adoption announcement can also have the names of any pets.  Most adoption announcements include pictures.  Prices range from two dollars a piece to five dollars a piece, plus shipping and handling.",

There are no two announcements a like, just like there are no two children exactly a like.  Every thing is new and exciting when there is a child in the home, whether the child is biological or adopted, that child will always hold a piece of your heart.  Everyday will bring something new and exciting.  Not only will you be teaching your child but your child will be teaching you.  This is what makes parenting so exciting and also so terrifying.",
            "There is nothing more wonderful than having a child to call your own.  Adopting is a wonderful way to have this.  Adoptive parents have so much fun exploring and make things just right for their new children.  So preparing the adoption announcements should be just that, fun and exciting.",
            "First you should take into consideration the people that you will send the adoption announcements too.  That will give you an idea of what all should be contained in the announcement.  Weather they should be humorous or sentimental.  After you have your words chosen your layout picked and what style you want its time to shop.  Depending on how many you are sending bulk mail may be appropriate.  This is a good way to save money on postage.",
            "Many people also have welcome home parties after the adopted member of the family is settled in, while you are working on your announcements can be a good time to consider such a party where as you won't have to mail out separate invitations.",

To those who may not know what adoption photo listing is, it is where an adoption agency or the local Division of Social Services has pictures and information of children for adoption on the internet.  This is done to improve the chances of the child for finding a family.  There are more than 100,000 children in the United States in foster care and hundreds of thousands around the world in orphanages or substitute care.  All the children listed on photo listing are for adoption and need a permanent home.  Most of these children have special needs.  Many of the children are over the age of seven, and the majority of the them are much older.  These children have physical, emotional, mental and/or learning disabilities.  You will find several sibling groups that wish to stay together.  In all states you must have finished your home study before you can adopt.",
            "After reading the description of a child you can request more information.  Adoption Photo listing started in 1994 and over 8,000 children have appeared on it. The Adoption Photo list recieves more than two million hits per month.  Adoption photo listing is such a powerful way to motivate people even remotely interested in adopting.  Many people have a statistic in the back of their minds, knowing that there are millions of children around the world without a home.  But that's just it, it's just a statistic.  With adoption photo listing it is no longer just a statistic it is reality.  Adoption photo listing places a face where it used to be just a number.  Not only does it become a picture, but adoption photo listing describes the child.  It gives the Childs age, bithdate, state of residence, and the Childs likes and dislikes.",
            "Adoption photo listing is not only beneficial for the child wanting to be adopted, but also beneficial for the adoptive parents.  This way the child gets his or her face out there for more to see.  Also the adoptive parents have a chance to see pictures and learn about the children.  What the children look like, what they like to do, where they come from and sometimes an update on how the child is doing emotionally.  This give the adoptive parents more to go on than just a picture or even a number.",
            "Adoption photo listing is not just of children for adoption, but also of families or couples that want to adopt.  These adoptive parents have been thoroughly screened and have completed all of the prescreening assessments.  Many of them have fertility problems, making it near impossible to have children on their own.  These adoption photo listings give information such as the ages of the adoptive parents, when they where married, what their hobbies are and the information about any of the children they have whether they are biological or adopted.  They also explain how much they would like to adopt and raise a child, and how wonderful it would be just to be considered for adopting.",

There are some states that require more information such as dental history, immunization records, developmental history, and of course school records.  Some adoption Records also hold information on whether or not the child being put up for adoption is eligible for any state of federal adoption assistance.  Those states include: Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont.",

This information is gathered during a home study as well and it includes information such as the medical and genetic history of the family, the family and social background, a mental health history of the family, a religious background, and the level of education attained by the parents.  Some states require also the physical appearance, talents, hobbies, field of occupation, and a list of any drugs the birth mother toke during her pregnancy with the child.  There are a few states that if obtainable, will also provide the adoptive parents with the names, addresses and any other identifying information about the birth family.  These states are Colorado, New York, and American Samoa.",

Once a family has been chosen for a child they do a check on the family to make sure that the home will be suitable for the child being adopted.  The information that they collect is relatively simple.  When they do the home study for the adoptive family they include such things as a criminal background check, and they also check with the local child abuse registry.  They will also include the adoptive parents' physical health, emotional maturity, financial situation, and a family and social background.",
            "Montana seems to be the hardest state to adopt from, they ask for Employment history, history of drug and alcohol abuse, racial ethnic background, and a history of domestic violence.

Michigan, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, West Virginia, Puerto Rico, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Colorado, Illinois, Arizona, and the District of Columbia also ask for some of these items for the adoption records.",

If the adoption record is sealed it generally stays that way until the adopted child comes of age."

            "Adoption is a life-changing event for all involved, from the birth parents who make the brave decision to give their child up, to the adoptive parents who make an equally brave decision to welcome that child as their own. Yet one group which may go overlooked is that of the adopted children themselves. There are a number of issues that can arise for these individuals.",
            "If the child was adopted at a very young age, they may not even know they were adopted until adolescence, or even later. A possible conflict in identity may result, as these children have spent so much time in an identity which they may perceive to no longer be valid. Children who were adopted late enough in life to be cognizant of the process can have their own issues, as well, perhaps wondering why their original parents didn't keep them, or having trouble accepting their adoptive parents as legitimate. Children adopted by parents of an ethnic, racial, or cultural group other than their own often face a unique conflict as they try to reconcile the two identities internally.",
            "It has been shown that adult former adoptees suffer from a number of problems, including struggles with identity, low self-esteem, and feelings of abandonment. These underlying troubles may lead to further struggles like alcohol abuse, marital difficulties and depression. Many adult adoptees will also seek out information about their own genetic histories, spending years trying to find siblings, parents or any other biological relatives. The upshot of these issues is that they are nothing new. They are so frequently encountered that they are known about and there exist mechanisms to help these individuals cope.",
            "One option is to find a support group. The mere act of connecting with a group of people who have had similar life experiences and dealt with similar issues can be beneficial in itself. The clich\u00e9 is that misery loves company, and in this case it's true. Seeing that others are going through some of the same things is reassuring. Support groups provide a forum in which former adoptees can discuss their experiences and confess their troubles. National support groups such as ALMA and the American Adoption Congress are good resources for adult adoptees.",
            "Individual counseling is another option. Some counselors and therapists specialize in adult adoptees. Some of these professionals are adult adoptees themselves. The therapeutic intervention can treat a number of aspects of the adult adoptee experience. Therapy can help the individual in their interpersonal relationships, help them heal from lingering feelings of abandonment, and even assist in the search for birth parents (which can be a cathartic solution in itself). This kind of counseling can be costly, but some counselors offer group sessions, which may combine some of the advantages of support groups and individual counseling.",
            "For the adopted individual, adoption is a lifelong experience. It does not end when the adoption is finalized, nor at the onset of adulthood. It is something that adoptees carry around throughout their lives, and as such it must be addressed and coped with. Fortunately, there are resources for these individuals. For those struggling with issues like those described above, a good starting point is www.adopting.org, a website with resources geared to all people touched by adoption, including adult adoptees."

            "In sports, there pundits who oppose using statistics alone to measure a player's performance. They say that these numbers only tell part of the story and fail to capture certain intangible aspects of the game that cannot be quantified. This is particularly true of adoption statistics, which are unfortunately incomplete. There is no one body which tracks adoption statistics, leaving what numbers are available scattered somewhat outdated. Useful figures can still be found, however, and serve to paint part of the adoption picture.",
            "Perhaps one of the more striking numbers is the number of Americans who are personally touched by adoption in one way or another. A study done in 1997 by the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute found that 60% of Americans had an adoption experience. As defined by the authors of the study, this means that either the participant or one of their family members or close friends had adopted, had placed a child for adoption, or was adopted. Although the research is ten years old, it's still quite interesting, as its findings mean that people who have been affected by adoption compose a majority in the United States.",
            "Another tale is told by examining the demographics of women who place their children for adoption prenatally. As it turns out, the likelihood that a woman will place their unborn child has an inverse relationship with socioeconomic status (SES) and level of education within the birth mother's family. For example, if a woman's mother completed at least one year of college, then she is statistically three times more likely to place a child for adoption than a woman whose mother did not finish high school, according to one study. Researchers explain such trends by claiming that these women come from families which are generally more supportive than those of women from lower SES and educational backgrounds. One California study bucks this trend, however, finding that women who placed their children tended to not have an education beyond high school.",
            "It was stated above that most of the extant statistics pertaining to adoption are inaccurate or outdated. As with all things, however, financial records remain meticulous, allowing for an accurate estimate of the costs of adoption. The biggest factor influencing adoption cost is the kind of agency of involved. A domestic adoption via a public agency may cost as much as $2500 down to nothing at all. On the other hand, that same adoption when handled by a private agency can cost as little as $4000, or upwards of $30,000. The difference is due largely to the fact that public agencies are subsidized by the state, and private agencies often offer more support services which can be costly.",
            "As stated above, these statistics paint only a small part of the picture of adoption. They are merely descriptive, and do not necessarily predict future adoption figures or trends. They do however, provide a certain degree of insight and can be useful for those considering either adopting or placing a child for adoption."

This is not always the case.  Unfortunately there are several children who do not get adopted and age out of the systems at age eight-teen.",
            "Whether Americans have any experience with adoption, not everyone understands it or supports it.  The history of adoptions can be traced back as far as the 18th century BC.  Adoption was very common during the Ancient periods, and generally involved adults not children.  These adults where used to carry on family heritage or to protect property rights.  It has been found that both men and women whether married or single could adopt.  Our modern adoption laws find heritage in the Hammurabi Code of the 18th century BC.  Ancient Times focused on adoption of adults, while during the Middle Ages it focused on children and set some good ground rules.  In Ancient Times, the adoptions where merely saying that you wanted someone to follow in your footsteps.  During the Middle Ages there were specific laws put into place to protect the child and all adoptions during this time period where handled by the court systems.  The first state adoption was in 1851 in Massachusetts.  In 1853, Rev. Charles Loring Brace founded a children's aid program to help orphaned and abandoned children.  His solution was to get the children off the streets and send them to strong Christian homes.  These children where gathered up and placed on trains bound for the mid-west.  At each stop the children where displayed for all to see, and who ever was not chosen was placed back on the train to go to the next stop.",
            "Things have certainly changed since then.  But one thing has remained the same, we still want what's best for the children.  Even though sometimes it's hard to know what's best.  Adoption has become a wonderful thing and has been a good chance for children without a home for centuries."

            "A frequent question among those people looking to become adoptive parents is that of what the children are like. This is understandable, of course. After all, before welcoming a child into one's home, it is useful to know what options are available and what one can expect of the child. Since all children are different, there is no single or precise way to answer this question. By examining the various kinds of children who are generally adopted, it is possible to paint something of a general picture.",
            "One option is to adopt an infant born within the U.S. The infants placed for public adoption are generally African-American, Hispanic or mixed-race. The number of Caucasian infants placed for public adoption is relatively small in comparison, as these children are generally handled by private adoption agencies. Adopting an infant is preferable for those people who wish to raise their adopted child from a very early age, possibly to simulate the experience of raising a birth child. Because this is such a widely sought option, it can often be difficult to find a readily available child, often resulting in long waiting periods before being able to adopt.",
            "A second domestic option is to adopt a child who is already in foster care and waiting for a family. These children tend to be older, from grade school age up to adolescence. They may have special needs, such as emotional, mental, or physical disability, or they may be part of a sibling group that must be placed together. Often called \"waiting children,\" these special cases are handled by both public and private adoption agencies, with entities called adoption exchanges helping to provide matches between child and parent. Often, adoption subsidies are available to help offset the cost of caring for a child with special needs.",
            "A third option is to adopt internationally. Children are available for adoption in over fifty foreign countries. These children have been put for adoption for a variety of reasons, often linked to the nation or culture in which their parents live. In South Korea, for example, unwed mothers are looked upon shamefully, so would-be single moms often put their infant up for adoption. Often these children are living in orphanages, just waiting for someone to adopt them. The process of adopting from abroad can be a tedious one, but there are agencies and attorneys that will facilitate the process.",
            "No matter which option is right for a certain individual, one theme remains the same: there are children who need to be adopted. From infancy to adolescence, both at home and overseas, there are children who are without families. For prospective birth parents who do not have the means to raise a child, and for people looking to start a family, adoption is a solution to be considered. If you or someone you know is thinking of adopting and would like some more information, some good online resources include Adoption.com and Adopting.org, both of which are aimed at providing information on adoption to pertinent parties. AdoptableKids.com is an online adoption exchange where one can search and browse photo listings of hundreds of kids currently waiting to be adopted."

Sometimes she gets to run in wide open spaces, like at the park, sometimes she runs alongside her mom's bike, and sometimes she just runs back and forth through the house. To her, it doesn't much matter, just as long as she gets to run. The way her life started out, however, it was possible that she might never have gotten the chance.",
            "Paloma is a one-year-old half English setter/half English pointer mix. Her name, which is Spanish for \"dove,\" was bestowed upon her because as a very young puppy, she was entirely white. The result of an accidental breeding between two show dogs, Paloma and her six sisters were unexpected and unwanted by the owners of both parent dogs. Fortunately, all seven dogs made their way to a pointer rescue shelter, and have since all found happy homes.",
            "Paloma's story is not a unique. Thousands of dogs across the country are in need of rescuing and go unadopted. Often these animals spend the rest of their lives in shelters, colloquially known as \"the pound.\" Those that are not cannot be adopted are euthanized. The reasons these dogs wind up in shelters vary. Some of them were bought as Christmas presents for a child, but soon the parents had second thoughts as it became clear that the puppy might be more trouble than they anticipated. Others ran away and were picked up by animal control or the local human society, but went unclaimed by their owners. Still others had to be given up due to their owner's allergies or other health problems. Yet most of these dogs still have plenty of years of companionship and affection left in them, and would love nothing more than to be taken in by someone who will love and care for them.",
            "Some people may be hesitant to adopt a shelter dog, for fear of health or behavior problems. While some dogs may have behavior problems as a result of being abused or neglected by their previous owners, not all shelter dogs are like this, and those that are can usually be re-trained by someone who happens to be particularly patient. Dog lovers are encouraged to ask questions about a dog's background before adopting, in order to avoid potential problems and frustrations. Nearly all shelters will not allow a dog to be adopted until any health problems have been successfully treated. Any information on treatment of chronic conditions or other special needs will be passed on to the new owner.",

Adoption is often cheaper than buying a puppy, and the dogs are just as friendly and loving, if not more so. Plus, most are already housebroken! To get started on the search a new best friend, call your local humane society or search online at PetFinder.com."

You can find dog adoptions through a shelter, rescue group, or through a non-for-profit organization online.  Dogs end up in shelters for many reasons, such as its owner dies, someone has to move or their financial situation changes, a dog is lost and can not find its way home, a person develops health problems and can no longer care for the dog, or develops allergies.  The Humane Society of the United States estimates that three to four million dogs and cats are euthanized every year, due to a lack of homes.",
            "The adoption process for dogs is fairly simple and can take anywhere from thirty minutes to two days.  To adopt a dog you will need to fill out an application and a questionnaire.  If both are accepted the shelter will call any landlords that you might have, to make sure you can have the dog where you live.  If this checks out then in some cases, someone will come out to your home and make sure you have an adequate home and yard for the dog to live in.  Once this is complete you will be asked to pay an adoption fee, ranging from $50.00 to $350.00.  Then the dog will be spayed or neutered before going home.  There is no exception to this rule, it is a must.  Two to three days after surgery you will be able to pick your new pet up and take it home.",

There is a big difference in dog personalities, so depending on what the dog will be primarily for is depending on what bread you will want.  You should also remember that not all dog breads are good with children and some breeds are not good with other animals.  Where as allot can be told by breeds or what breads make up the mix, each dog will have its own personality.  The temperament varies, and is unique to each individual dog.  Most places that do dog adoptions will allow you a visitation period, some will even require it.  This is a good idea and should be taken advantage of.  Spending time with a potential dog will tell you volumes about their individual unique personality.  This can also clue you in on weather or not they will be good with children and other animals.",

If your shelter offers a visitation it should be taken advantage of, bring your children and any other pets that you might have.  Check with you local shelter and rescues to find out what they require as far as adopting a dog.  You might also ask them what their fees are and if they offer animal visitation.  Once you have done the research then you can begin your process of a dog adoption."

            "There are a whole lot of dogs out there up for adoption, the good news is that a lot of them would probably fit into your unique situation well. The bad news is there are several that probably will not. Let's start with breed. Weather it is a pure bred Dog you want to adopt or a mix breed you can generally tell how big it will be and a few things about its general temperament by some simple breed research. While you can't learn everything about that particular dog you can learn quite a bit about the kind of dog that you would want to adopt. Certain breeds are said not to be as good with children as others however, some of those very same breeds are better at home security. So again it comes down to what it is that you want out of the dog you are trying to adopt.",
            "Size can also be told by breed, or at least guessed at by what breeds make up your mix.  Some dogs for adoption should only reach five pounds where others may grow well over two-hundred and five. So If you are looking for a large dog you should look into larger breeds such as, Great Danes, Rottwillers, Saint Bernard's, Great Pyrenees, Labradors and so on. If your individual needs require a smaller companion than maybe a medium sized dog say around thirty to sixty pounds is what you are looking for in the dog that you adopt. In that case maybe you should look into breeds or mixes that include some of the following: Collie, Sheperd, Spits, Spaniel, Boxer, or chow just to name a few. Though sometimes they are considered more hyperactive your dog adoption needs require a small dog to adopt. In this case you may want to look at breeds such as, Tea cup poodles, Daushound, Papillion, Bichon Frise, Pomeranian, and so many others in the miniature category.",
            "The age of the dog that you are to adopt can also be of great importance to a person. With age comes some benefits, generally they are already house trained or are outside animals that have grown accustom to life that way. An older animal will be less likely to steal your slippers as a chew toy, or eat the paper rather than bringing it to you. Puppies on the other hand can be a hand full, however you get to decide how they are trained and what things the can and can't do in your house from day one. Though they generally learn fast, they require much more time and attention than an older animal. Puppies have more energy and less control they need constant supervision, and lots of loving attention. The payoff for all your hard work is a very attached dog that will be loyal. There are pros and cons to any age dog that you chose to adopt, the choice is really about what fits your situation.",
            "The process is quite simple and will require a small adoption fee. In some cases you will be required to submit an application so that you can be verified as a good pet owner. It is recommended that you visit with the dog on site, if you have children bring them with you so that you can see how the dog will interact with them. All in all adopting a dog is a rewarding adventure."

If you are sure that you can spend the time and money on a dog then you should check with your local animal shelters for your free dog adoption.

Do not do a free adoption because you are unable to buy a dog.  Do a free dog adoption because you want to welcome a homeless dog into your home and your heart.",

Then you need to go and start looking for the right dog for you.  Now remember that this may take more than one trip.  Once you have found the right dog it will be time to start the application process.  You may also be required to do a home study so to speak.  This is where someone form the shelter comes to your home and makes sure that your yard and home are adequate for a dog.  Once the application process is finished you will be required to pay the veterinarian fees and then you can take you new dog home."

Americans adopted roughly 3,783 children from Guatemala in 2005.  With Guatemalan adoption there is no travel required.  They also accept single parents.  Before adoptions are approved a DNA test is required by the United States.  This is done to prove the mother-child connection.  Six months of supervision is also required after adopting from Guatemala.",

Guatemala started doing international adoption at the end of their thirty-six year Civil War.  The war ended officially in 1996.  The reason the United States requires DNA testing of the child and the birth mother is because there have been rumors of babies being stolen and sold or place for adoption.",

Once you have chosen the right referral for you, the adoption agency will contact Guatemala and let them know which child you have chosen.  A Guatemalan attorney will then collect the consent forms, medical records, and birth certificate.  The United States will do the necessary DNA testing.  Once all this is done the attorney goes to court for you to finish the adoption.  He then gets the Childs passport ready.  When all the paperwork and court hearings are finished you have the choice to either go to Guatemala and pick up your child or have the child escorted to you.",
            "In Guatemalan adoptions you can be married, or single, meaning single men and single women can adopt.  The only real requirement is that the adopting parents be under the age of fifty years old.  Referrals generally start around three to six months after your paperwork has been received.  Once you accept a referral it takes about eight months for the adoption to become final.",
            "An international protocol was endorsed by law makers, because the United States said they will stop allowing American parents adopt Guatemalan children.  Guatemala has been told that it needs to make provisions of its secret systems.  These systems have been criticized due to high adoptive cost and for payment being made to the women and young girls placing their children up for adoption.  Guatemalan adoption is still probably on the better choices for single adoptive parents due to the flexibility of their current protocol.  Also with private lawyer's currently still in charge of a great deal of the process, this is also a good alternative for people currently turned down for domestic adoption."

            "When choosing to adopt a child, some prospective parents make the decision to partake in an international adoption. That is, they choose to adopt a child from a country other than their own. This process can be long and full of bureaucratic red tape, especially since it is a matter conducted entirely between the potential adoptive parents and a foreign court, which acts on behalf of the foreign government. The United States government cannot intervene on the parents' behalf. There a few reasons and some benefits to this option, however.",
            "Aside from the usual reasons for which one would choose to adopt, there are a couple of reasons why international adoption specifically may be a preference. One reason can be benevolence. The major countries from which children are adopted into the United States all have glaring social problems which drive the international adoption process. China, for example, has strict population control laws which often force Chinese parents to give their children (especially girls) up for adoption. Russia suffers from poverty to such an extent that raising a child is often not feasible. Americans who adopt children from these environments and others like them may decide that they wish to rescue a child from such circumstances and bring him or her into the home.",
            "A second-- and perhaps more substantial-- reason for international adoption is the decline in availability of children for adoption in the United States. The number of adoptions which were conducted transnationally has more than tripled in the last 15 years, due largely to a decrease in potential adoptees available domestically.",
            "The potential benefits to the adopted child are fairly obvious. She is raised in a nurturing home by people who wanted the child so badly that they went to great lengths and expense to adopt her. In nearly all cases, the child moves up in socioeconomic class after being adopted. The child may also experience educational opportunities which may not have otherwise been available. While these benefits may be obvious, there are more complex and perhaps more obscure impacts on the societies and cultures involved at both ends of the adoption process.",
            "For those interested in international adoption, there are a number of resources available. First of all, it is advisable to first learn about domestic open adoption and explore domestic options before looking abroad. There can be certain risks associated with international adoption. That said, there are many children available in more than fifty countries, all of whom who are legally free for adoption and are in need of caring homes.",
            "One good place to start on the journey toward adopting a child from abroad is the website Adoption.com. The site has a great number of resources to answer all questions adoption. They have a section of the site devoted solely to international adoption (http://international.adoption.com). The United States State Department also has some information about intercountry adoption available online (http://travel.state.gov/family/adoption/adoption_485.html). This page clarifies the role that the U.S. government may be able to play in the adoption process, as well as providing phone numbers to call for more information on international adoption.",
            "A final word: international adoption is a long process full of bureaucratic hurdles. It can be costly and may require prospective parents to reside in the country of the child's origin for a period of time before the process is complete. Like all things that require effort, however, people who endure the process ultimately find it to be worthwhile."

            "International adoption offers may benefits and a few hardships.  The pros of international adoption are as follows: there are a lot of children to be adopted of both sexes, from infancy and up in age.  Once you have an accepted home study you are all but guaranteed a child.  With international adoptions you know how long it will take (usually around twelve to eight-teen months).  The natural mother will not change her mind, all the children for international adoption are orphans.  Once you agree to a referral you will become the parent of that child.  You will know in advance how much all the fees are.  You will get to travel to another country.  The cons are as follows: you will not get a newborn; most infants are at least four months old.  The Childs heritage and medical information is not always known.  The child might have development problems, but should bounce back quickly.  There is a ton of paperwork required.",
            "International adopting means that we have to follow the rules and laws of our country and the country that we are adopting from.  Every country has conditions like age limits, income guidelines, number of children in the home, maritial stability, and gender (single applicants).",
            "The steps for an international adoption can be difficult.  First you need to decide what country in which you would like to adopt.  You should think about the cultural differences and weather or not you can really deal with them.  Consider your family and friends, talk with them and ask them what their opinions and thoughts on the matter might be.  You might ask them how they might feel about it.  You age and marital status will help you know what countries you can adopt from.  Once you have done that then you can narrow it down to one.",
            "Once you have chosen a country, you will need to choose an agency that can help you along the way.  You should remember when choosing an agency you need to feel comfortable about the people that you will be working with.  You also need to make sure that the agencies you are looking at handle international adoptions.  Once you have picked your agency it is time to start the paperwork.  The agency will assign a social worker to your case.  The social worker will come to your home and interview you and any children in your home.  They will also want to interview your friends and family.  This is called an international home study.",
            "Once the home study has been accepted, it is time to start collecting paperwork for your dossier.  All this is, is a collection of paperwork.  A dossier is a requirement for international adoptions.  All documents must be signed and notarized and then sent off to be translated and approved.  Once the dossier is finished and accepted you should start receiving referrals of children for adoption.  Now all you have to do is accept a referral.  You're almost done.  It is time to travel to the country you're adopting from for court, and then usually ten days after court you get to bring your child home to meet their new family."

Whatever your particular taste, when shopping for a new pet, consider adopting an animal from a shelter as an alternative to high priced pet stores. One convenient way to do this is to use a website like PetFinder.com. The selection is fantastic, and you can search without having to leave the house!",
            "An advantage to beginning the pet search online is the powerful search tools at your disposal. At PetFinder.com, for instance, a search function allows users to narrow down animals based on breed, age, size, gender, and range (i.e., how far the animal is from the person searching). Looking for a female Shih Tzu near Montclair, NJ? There are well over 100 listings on PetFinder.",

After all, part of the experience of owning a pet is raising and training it as your own. But while puppies and kittens are awfully cute, they are also a handful. They require a lot of work, training and patience. They have more energy than you may have ever though possible, and they are in constant need of attention. For some, the joy of a baby animal is worth enduring these difficulties. For those who want an animal but not the aggravation, mature pets are the way to go. A lot of the animals on pet adoption websites are from shelters, so there are plenty of adults available...but there are also plenty of adorable puppies and kittens who need homes, too. Whichever is your preference, you will be able to find it online.",

The animal's location, breed, general age, gender and name are listed right on the results page. There are also icons that give any special housing needs, such as for animals who need to be in a home without small children or other animals. When you see an animal you like, click on its name to read more about it. From there, it's just a matter of a phone call or e-mail to initiate the eventual process of adoption.",

There are a variety of ethnicities such as Asian, Gypsy, Mediterranean, and Caucasian.  Children of both sexes are available, but there are more boys than girls.  Russian children will remain on the adoption list for six months before being considered for international adoption.  This way they have a chance to be adopted by a Russian family.  Many of the children in Russian orphanages come from teenage pregnancies, although a few are truly orphans.  A handful of them are there because the families couldn't afford to care for them.",

The Russian Government began a review in 2005 of international adoption procedures, and changes are expected.  Fees range from agency to agency but are usually somewhere around $19,900 to $25,500.  This does not include travel, immigration filing, visa, document preparation or collection.",

You should research the different agencies and request information packets from the ones that you might be interested in.  In Russia only married couples or single women can adopt.  They believe the woman to be the main caregiver.  Once you have chosen an agency, you can begin you journey for a Russian adoption.  The entire Russian adopting process usually takes about nine months.  You start by doing a home study.  The home study is basically a report on what the social worker has found out about the adoptive parents.  Once you have finished the home study you will have to complete the Dossier.  This is paper work that the Russian Government requires.",

Most countries require that the notary's commission be valid for at least a year past the date they witness a signature.  When the paper work has been gathered and notarized, your agency will send it to Russia to be translated and notarized, and then they will give the paper work to the Russian authorities.",

They used to just send you a picture and travel information, but in April of 2000, Russia changed the regulations to include that the adopting parents must receive their referrals personally, before the Russian Ministry on Education.  When you receive your referral it should include a video tape of the child and any medical information on the child.  If for some reason you are not happy with the referral, then your agency should work with you until you are happy.  Once you are satisfied with your referral your agency will contact the Russian authorities to prepare the documents for the child being adopted.  When the paper work is finished your agency should then contact you and let you know of your departure date and any travel information that you may need to know.  Once you agree to a referral, families will take two trips to Russia.  Most adoptive children are ready within six months of finding a family.  Trip one is usually five to seven days.  Usually one month after agreeing to the referral.",
            "Families generally wait two to four months between the first and second trip.  The second trip is usually about ten days.  The adopted child will be able to go home ten days after the court hearing.

            "One form of same sex adoption is called \"second parent adoption,\" in which one partner can adopt the biological or adoptive child of the other partner without terminating the parental rights of the parent. So, theoretically, one member of a same sex partnership could adopt a child as a single parent. Then, the other partner could adopt the same child, essentially making each partner a parent to the child. This process would not work in Florida or Utah. The former forbids adoption by a homosexual, and the latter does not allow adoption by anyone in a cohabiting relationship that is not a legal marriage. Oddly enough, single people may adopt in Utah.",
            "Second parent adoption within same sex partnerships is explicitly permitted in the states of California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington, as well as in Washington, D.C. In the remaining 38 states, however, any laws regarding adoption by same sex couples are ambiguous at best. With the legal status of civil unions and same sex marriages being pushed to the forefront as a social issue, it may only be a matter of time before these ambiguities and obscurities are shaken out.",
            "Much of the reason for the lack of explicit language on same sex adoption is that it is relatively new as a social issue, at least within the public consciousness. Another reason is because it is often seen as such a controversial subject. It is a hotly contested issue, with firmly held opinions on each side.",
            "Some opponents object to gay adoption on moral grounds. They feel that homosexuality is amoral in itself, and so adoption by homosexuals is amoral by extension. They may also believe that participants in same sex relationships cannot perform as well as parents as traditional heterosexual parenting units. Several organizations, among them the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics hold that homosexual couples are just as qualified to be parents as heterosexual couples.",
            "There are others who fear that being raised by a same sex couple will influence a child to be homosexual, or that there may be a detrimental effect on the child's overall well-being. Research has shown that this is not the case, however, as the sexual orientation of parents is not related to that of their children and that children of same sex couples perform just as well on several measures of overall well-being. What's more, a study conducted UCLA estimates that disallowing adoption by LGBT couples can cost the United States between $87 million and $120 million annually. Researchers say this is because these couples are often willing to adopt children that heterosexual couples are not, such as older children, children with behavioral problems, and children who are HIV positive. If these children go unadopted, the financial strain of their care falls on the foster care system, sapping government funds.",

            "The outcome of a child being raised in a same sex home is unknown.  Many same sex couples are finding it more and more difficult to adopt and instead turn to insemination or sera get mothers.  Some states allow one parent to adopt and then the second parent to do a domestic stepparent adoption.  There are no international adopting countries that allow same sex couples either and if you gay or lesbian and single, if you keep your sexuality under wraps you may have better luck adopting.  In Massachusetts, California, and Vermont, where same sex marriage is legal, they still recommend that the second parent file for stepparent adoption.  This way the federal government will recognize the legality of the parent-child relationship.",
            "Other than there unique hang ups and legal difficulty, the process is typically the same.  A home study is required.  So are the standard background checks.  None of the steps are different, only getting those accomplished takes some breaking through taboos and stereo types.  In general a lot of red tape.  In some cases things tend to go right through when the judge is on your side, if he or she is not then there could be friction there too.",
            "Regardless of where you decide to adopt, one thing is for certain due to how new this idea is for mainstream America same sex adoptions are likely to be an uphill battle for some time to come.  Gay and lesbian couples will still be able to adopt after overcoming the challenges of their sexual orientation.  And though little is known about how same sex parenting impacts a child raised in these circumstances, one could scrutinize that many have adopted already, and there are a lot of well adjusted children living in those situations, or it would not still be allowed."

            "Adopting a small dog can be done through several different avenues.  Shelters are a good source for finding small dogs to adopt, both pure bread and mixed breads alike.  The process is rather simple and generally requires an adoption fee and sometimes a pet owner check.  This helps them to know what kind of pet owner you have been in the past.  It is always a good idea to spend time with the dog before you adopt it.  If you have children you should bring them along for the first orientation.",
            "Some small dog breads have bread specific medical conditions.  For instance Daushounds of regular or miniature variety are more prone to back and hip problems.  Some simple bread research will reveal most of these medical issues.",
            "Another avenue for small dog adoption would be rescues.  Some of the more popular breads such as, bichon frise, Papillion, miniature pincher, dashound, Yorkshire, pug, Boston terrier ect.. Have bread specific rescues.  Other rescues are more general and have mixed breads as well.  If after you have finished your research, you found that particular bread fits you better, this avenue would probably work best for you.",
            "Some small dog breads should not be adopted if there are small children in the home.  Breads such as pugs and miniature boxers are just a couple.  The smaller breads are too easy for a small child to hurt.  This can happen by falling on them or stepping on them.  Also some small dog breads are more likely to nip and bite.  Small dogs should be adopted into a home where there are older people or a family with older children.",
            "Small dogs are rambunctious and require attention.  They need room to run.  Small dogs tend to be more hyper than larger dogs.  These are things that you should consider when wanting to adopt a small dog.  Other things to consider when wanting to adopt a small dog are time, money, and love.  Whenever you adopt a dog large or small you should make sure that you have time to take care of it.  You also need to make sure that you have the money to deal with any medical issues and mandatory maintenance of the dog.  Then of course there is love all animals need love to survive and grow.  Small dogs make good pets for apartment dwellers and anyone who likes to have a warm lap.  Also it is good to remember that in most cases it is easier to control a ten pound dog than it is a do twice that size.",
            "You should weigh your options and look at the pros and cons of small dog adoption.  Take in our surrounding and ask yourself if this is what's right for you.  Check with your landlord to see if there are any pet policies, and maybe talk to someone you know that has a small dog or has adopted a small dog.  Make sure that the decision you make is the right one for you and your situation."

            "For Americans looking to adopt internationally, Russia has long been had a stable adoption program. Russia has typically been the third most popular sending country for international adoptions in the United States. Russian children who are given up for adoption typically are so because the poverty level in the country is such that raising a child would be difficult or impossible for the lower class parents. The result is that a large number of Russian children are made available for foreign adoption.",
            "Recently, however, attempts at reform within the Russian adoption system have led to major delays in the adoption process. A recently passed Russian law requires adoption agencies to be re-accredited. The process of applying for and being granting accreditation and licensing has proven to be a slow one, resulting in the delays that are currently being seen.",
            "Applications for accreditation must be reviewed by five Russian government ministries: Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of these ministries sometimes requires clarification or additional information on certain applications, which leads to further delay. The website for the United States Embassy in Moscow cites one example in which the Ministry of Justice recently returned several applications to the agencies, asking for further information1. The Ministry of Education can only sign off on the accreditation after receiving approval from each of the four other ministries. At the time of this writing (May 30, 2007) the Ministry of Education had not announced a date by which the review will be complete, and no adoption agencies had yet been accredited by the ministry.",
            "These postponements in the adoption process have had some other consequences, as well. For example, prospective adoptive parents are having trouble traveling to Russia for their adoption visits. Russian adoptions require two such visits, the first being about a week and the second lasting two to three weeks. The Russian government issues visas to adopting parents for these visits, with specific parameters indicating the dates of the visit. However, because all adoptions are falling behind schedule, Americans are attempting to travel to Russia outside the dates specified on their visas. This can be especially problematic if they are able to travel to Russia, but wind up staying beyond the departure date of the visa. Significant delays in departing Russia can occur.",
            "For the moment, adoptions in Russia are still mired in the bureaucratic accreditation process. The Russian government and the Ministry of Education are unable to say when the review might be over and adoptions will be back up to speed. For those wishing to adopt a Russian child, it is still possible to do so, but one should be prepared to weather a significant waiting period. If enduring the process is not feasible, there are plenty of other countries with available children to consider. Some other viable options include China, South Korea, Guatemala, and many countries in Africa. News and updates on the Russian adoption process are available from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow website:",

Hoping that the color difference would not match up to the love and belonging the child would feel with its new family.  There are fewer young white children available for adoption, leaving adoptive parents feeling the need to reach out and help any child in need, regardless of race.  There are different opinions on Tran racial adoption, one is that a child should be put in a home with at least one parent of the same race. Others believe that race should not be considered at all.",
            "To prepare for adoption it is important for everyone,  but even more important if you're contemplating Tran racial adoption to consider a few things.  When thinking of Tran racial adoption one should think about your personnel beliefs and you attitude toward race and ethnicity.  When you adopt a child who is considered different, the entire family will be different.  One needs to remember that to some, different is strange and sometimes scary.  Not everyone will understand your decision to adopt Tran racially.  Here are a few more things to ask yourself, where you live, is it integrated?  Are the schools in your area integrated?  Do you have friends that are different races and ethnicity?",
            "To Tran racially adopt you need to become seriously involved in parenting, you can not allow racially or ethnically prejudice remarks in your home.  You will need to encompass your family with support.  You should celebrate all cultures and do not be afraid to discuss race and culture.  Most importantly you should be there for your child and let them know that no matter what someone says to them and no matter how bad it hurts them that you are there for them and that you love them.  Parents of Tran racial adoption should encourage themselves and allow themselves to believe strongly that their family belongs together.  You should make it very clear that it is not ok to make fun of people who are different.  Teach your child to stand up to prejudice without starting fights.  They should learn to use their words not their fists.",
            "Many agencies are not open about Tran racial adoption policies, because it is such a touchy subject.  You should ask your agency about how they feel about it.  Tran racial adoption was the subject of a bill before congress in 1994, and after an intense debate they found that they agreed on one thing, that all adults of all backgrounds need to help adopted children of all backgrounds reach their potential.",
            "Tran racial adoption began after World War II, when there was a large number of children without a home or family.  American adoptive couples were not always childless, but simply family oriented.  Parents who adopt Tran racially can not ignore the fact that they become a minority family.  They will be subjected to questions, odd looks, and prejudice remarks.  Research shows that children raised in a Tran racial environment tend to handle the cultural gap extremely well, and that parents who adopt Tran racially have to work harder than same race parents, this way they can empower their children and teach them about different cultures and backgrounds.",
            "All in all, Tran racial adoption could be a wonderful experience for the right family.  You might have to work a little harder, but from what I have found it is all worth the effort."

First, you have to understand that the biological parents are permitted to have contact with the baby and they are able to have some type of relationship with the child. This doesn\u2019t mean that the child needs to see them or that you have to write to them. This could mean that you send pictures or that they send you things. You\u2019ll want to think of this as an agreement to keep each other updated. You also will find that the paperwork on the parents will still be open for the child, if they want to search for their biological parents.",

Keep in mind that you should talk to the biological parents if you feel uncomfortable with the biological parents calling. You\u2019ll want to keep some of the contact to a minimum or you may want to have an open relationship for your child\u2019s sake.",
            "There are definitely some rules that need to be laid down. You\u2019ll need to talk this out before the adoption and set the rules straight. This will help to deal with some of the stress that may be caused by having this joint relationship. You\u2019ll find that some biological parents will become very upset when pics are late or when they are missing their contact time.",

Adoptive parents under fifty years old are allowed to adopt a baby, while parents over fifty years old can only adopt older children.
