If you are one of those couples, then you might try searching the Internet for sites that offer information on wedding planners or browsing the yellow pages for the services of wedding planners.",
            "The process of listing down and cutting down everything into specific details\u2014the wedding date, the venue, the reception, the caterer, the designer of the gown and suit, all the way down to the wedding coverage\u2014are the areas wedding planner ushers in.",
            "A dependable wedding planner will take of the event on full or partial-service in terms of planning the big day. Most wedding planners offer its clientele conventional yet exceptional ideas and design to match the person or couple's personality.

This scheduled appointment is quite beneficial because the couple is given time to arrange their schedule and devote the time they have chosen to discuss their dream wedding details. Once the appointment is set, the wedding planner will gather a little information about what is to be discussed and get some suggestions from the couple so the firm can prepare packages and other offers for the client.",
            "Although planners help a lot in the entire wedding planning process, they might not cover everything needed for the event.

            "Have you ever had an uncontrollable urge to be pierced by a dozen needles? This is the image most people get when someone mentions the word \u201cacupuncture\u201d. It comes as no surprise that most view this technique with suspicion, even downright horror. The fact is, however, that this relatively painless ancient Chinese technique has helped relieve the symptoms of millions of people. Properly used, it can help in the management of many medical conditions including chronic pain and fatigue.",
            "How does needle puncture work?",
            "Practitioners of Chinese traditional medicine believe in energy flows. This energy, called Qi, circulates around the body using pathways called meridians. Meridians run very close to the surface of the skin in certain areas and can be accessed by needles. Much like plumbing, these pipes can get blocked or go the wrong way, causing health problems. The insertion of needles at these points is aimed to help loosen blocks and normalize flow.",
            "It sounds like a made-up explanation with no basis in reality, but there are numerous scientific studies which support the effects of acupuncture. Although the exact scientific basis is still unknown, recent theories seem to suggest involvement of complicated neurochemical effects in the brain, nerve to spinal cord impulse modulation, and microscopic connective tissue changes.",
            "What risks and side effects are of concern?",
            "The use of things not completely understood for the treatment of medical conditions is nothing new. Penicillin and aspirin were used for decades solely on the basis of their beneficial effects, without doctors knowing exactly how they worked. Results are what are truly important. However, it is equally important is to ensure that the technique is used safely.",
            "Like other strategies used in treating health conditions, acupuncture may have some side effects. Medications have side effects and allergic reactions, surgeries have risk of infection and complications. For needle puncture, there is a risk of injury, rare infections, minor bleeding, small bruises, and some dizziness.",
            "You can minimize the possible side effects by choosing a licensed acupuncturist. Most countries either have government licensing in place or have professional organizations with very strict rules and regulations.",
            "How do treatments go?",
            "An acupuncturist will do an initial evaluation of your medical history and your body\u2019s current state. Multiple pressure points are palpated, and a regimen of treatment is formulated. Most courses involve a series of 10 to 20 treatment sessions, each lasting 30 to 90 minutes. Needles will be carefully placed at the required points and kept in place for some time. Most patients report a feeling of mild sensation at the site of the puncture, but no real pain.",
            "Right after each acupuncture session, you will feel a bit tired and may need to rest. Some people feel an increase in their energy levels. The response to acupuncture is very individual. In some cases there is immediate relief of symptoms. For some patients, the beneficial effects may only be noticed after undergoing a few sessions. Do not be alarmed and keep your acupuncturist updated on what you are feeling to ensure everything is going as expected.",
            "You need never fear the thought of needles ever again. Acupuncture is a beneficial treatment with a long history of effectiveness. It is used to complement current medical therapy and should not replace currently existing medications or treatments.",
            "The safe application of this once exclusively Chinese therapy can now be experienced by chronic disease sufferers worldwide."

            "Using needles to adjust bodily functions to optimum levels is the principle behind acupuncture. Both ancient Chinese and modern Western practitioners have used this technique to relieve many sufferers of chronic disease. Needling is a relatively safe, beneficial treatment strategy that can be used to reduce pain, improve healing, and increase general well-being. But exactly how is this procedure done and what sort of benefits can be obtained?",
            "Procedure for Needle Puncture",
            "There are two broad categories of acupuncture practice today, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and medical acupuncture. Both have their merits, so the choice is individual. The decision for most people hinges upon which philosophy appeals more to them and which technique holds the least apprehension.",
            "In TCM, practitioners adhere to the concept of Qi, or energy flow, and the meridians in which they travel. They use longer needles and insert them deeper in order to reach the acupuncture points. Modern science has found little evidence to prove the existence of these energy channels, but this is the technique that has been used effectively for thousands of years.",
            "In medical acupuncture, the practitioners are graduates of western medical schools. Their application of needles is not based on the traditional acupuncture points, but on anatomic data. These acupuncturists use shorter needles and the insertions are shallower. They also tend to use fewer needles and leave them inserted for shorter periods of time. Adherents to TCM feel this is a watered-down version of the real thing. Nevertheless, many patients have felt relief of symptoms through this method.",
            "Conditions for Puncture Application",
            "There is a broad and extensive list of ailments which can be treated with acupuncture. The conditions run the gamut from asthma to constipation, anxiety to weight loss. Most TCM practitioners believe that any health condition results from an imbalance in Qi flow, therefore amenable to needle therapy. Western acupuncturists tend to have a more limited list of indications, the most common of which is undoubtedly control of pain.",
            "Control of pain is the most well researched of all of the indications for acupuncture. There is a definite beneficial effect for a majority of patients using this method. Migraines, premenstrual syndrome, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and neuralgias are but a few examples. The theory behind its effectiveness is also medically accepted and well researched, called the gate-control theory of pain. It states that the needles can stimulate nerves so that they block the impulses from pain triggers.",
            "Expected Puncture Session Result",
            "It is important to emphasize that acupuncture is used only on top of existing medical therapy. At no time should a patient discontinue medication or ignore medical instructions in favor of needle puncture. After undergoing a needle puncture regimen, the primary care physician can make an evaluation with regards to decreasing dependence on other therapies.",
            "A course of acupuncture therapy will last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. This depends upon the complexity of the particular medical condition. Results also vary, so it is important to have a frank discussion with the acupuncturist regarding expected results and their time frame. In general, the patient will begin to feel beneficial effects after three or four session. Certain specific conditions will actually get a little worse before improving so keeping informed is key.",
            "In modern medicine, the use of traditional techniques with proven results has become a widely accepted practice. Acupuncture has proven its worth time and again. Modern practice guidelines make it effective, reproducible, and safe. It is a gift of healing form ancient sages that has the potential to bring relief to millions of people."

            "Acupuncture is a holistic approach in treating and preventing certain diseases. Its main tool are very thin needles that are inserted to targeted points in the body. The body has about 400 of them linked through a system known as meridians or pathways. Once these are stimulated, these are supposed to create balance in the body.",
            "Autism on the other hand is a brain disorder that is long term. This disease is characterized by deficits in language, social communication and cognition. Children who are diagnosed with this illness may also suffer from secondary problems such as aggression, irritability, stereotypes, hyperactivity, negativism, volatile emotions, temper tantrums, short attention span and obsessive-compulsive behavior.",
            "Preliminary studies have shown that acupuncture may provide symptomatic relief to children suffering from autism. Although difficult at first, it is believed that it is rewarding in the long run. This is because while conventional therapy and treatment requires that the child stay still, acupuncture doesn\u2019t. Some say it\u2019s a quick prick at the vital points in the body.",
            "A group of children in the US participated in a test to see how effective acupuncture is among children. There are 22 respondents and each of them was given the treatment once every other day for four months.",
            "After the treatment 20 out of the 22 respondents showed remarkable improvement. In fact 2 of them has cerebral blood flow.  The only thing that did not change prior to treatment and after was the blood flow between the left and right cerebrum as it showed no differences.",
            "Aside from traditional acupuncture to help children with autism, a preliminary study in Hong Kong is trying to see if tongue acupuncture can produce better results.",
            "Results have showed that of 30 respondents in the test, majority showed functional improvement of various degrees depending on the age and severity of their disabilities. Some improvement was noticeable within a few TAC sessions, especially for drooling, spasticity (scissoring or tiptoeing), ataxia, and poor balance in walking. Functional improvement was noted after one to two courses of TAC. Most children tolerated TAC well, with only occasional pain and minor bleeding in some patients.",
            "The reason why tongue acupuncture is being experimented with is because there is a connection between the tongue and the heart through the meridians that spread to all the organs in the body. It is believed that the points on the tongue can influence the state of the other body organs thus giving relief to the one suffering from autism.",
            "But many believe that acupuncture alone cannot help autism sufferers. It has to be combined with other things like maintaining a certain diet to help improve one\u2019s mood and communication schools. Although it is only short term, it is better than nothing until a cure is found.",
            "When will the cure be found? Only time can tell as there are many other questions that have to be answered in order for doctors to further understand neurological disabilities. Doctors who are conducting research believe that an interdisciplinary approach is needed given that acupuncture has shown positive results in helping children with autism."

Unlike the cartoon where the balloon will pop and all the air will go out, the needles that are inserted into the vital points will stimulate the body to release endorphins thus helping the person control their appetite.",

The patient will have to come back for regular treatment and have to pay attention to one\u2019s diet and exercise regularly as needles can only do so much to control one\u2019s weight.",

            "Smoking is one hard habit to break. If nicotine patches and gum doesn\u2019t work, perhaps you should try something else like an alternative form of healthcare like acupuncture.",
            "Acupuncture is an ancient practice involving the use of needles. This instrument is inserted into the skin to allow you energy or Qi to start flowing freely around your body and thus help you quit smoking.",
            "When you go visit an acupuncturist for the first time and tell him or her that you want to quit smoking, after answering some questions, the specialist will carry out an examination of your ears and search for areas where the energy is low.",
            "Once these spots are identified, these sharp needles are then inserted. Usually 5 needles are placed in various acupoints.",
            "The treatment is finished after an hour and when the needles are removed, you are advised to wear ear magnets so your session continues even when you leave the clinic.  While acupuncture itself is a painless procedure, some smokers have claimed that they felt a prick or get sleepy.",
            "Most smokers will have to come to the clinic 4 to 6 times before seeing any significant results.  Just to give you an idea, one study shows that the respondents reported a decrease in the number of cravings to smoke just after one or two sessions. Seven out of 10 of the respondents were able to kick the habit after 5 or 6 sessions.",
            "Because the number of test subjects is small, there are some who doubt the effectiveness of acupuncture.  This is because although there are positive signs with regards to the short term effects of this technique, its effects were not sustained. This is why some medical journals have stated that it is unclear what acupuncture can do in smoking cessation.",
            "But you have to remember that acupuncture is not permanent. It merely starts something that you have to finish on your own. Some smokers who go 2 or 3 times a week to the clinic will need to come back for follow up sessions in the future.",
            "At the same time, you have to find ways to prevent yourself from picking up a cigarette. You can do this by staying away from people who smoke since you will be tempted to ask for a stick. You can create your own personal mantra which you repeat to yourself every time you have an urge.",
            "Remember that this craving is only short term and will last only for a few minutes. You have worked so hard to leave this behind so stick to the path and stay smoke free.",
            "Acupuncture treatment for smokers should only be done by a license professional. You can do some research online to find out if they are accredited by the National Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, ask how long they have been in the profession, find out how many smokers they have helped and how much will they charge.",
            "Once you have found one, you have to commit yourself to the program because both you and the acupuncturist have to work together to give up this habit.",
            "Acupuncture can help smokers in the same way that it has helped addicts and alcoholics quit their addictions. You just have to try it even if you may not believe in it."

        "summary": "",
        "content": [
            "The foundation of acupuncture rests on the relevance of an individual\u2019s chi in maintaining bodily and mental health. It is believed that chi is present in every living creature, and flows through specific pathways in the body. Health problems arise when the flow of chi on the body is blocked. As a result, a person may feel persistent headaches, muscle pain, fever, weakness, or in the worst case, becomes afflicted with more serious health conditions.",
            "A Deeper Explanation of Acupuncture",
            "Acupuncture has its origins in ancient Chinese philosophy and practice. More than ten thousand years ago, during the Old Stone Age of China, stones were fashioned into knives for medical purposes. After several years, during the New Stone Age, these stones were eventually made into needles intended for the same therapeutic end. These accounts are further evidenced by unearthed stone needles found to be of the same types used during the New Stone Age.",
            "There are basically 14 pathways throughout the body where chi flows continuously. These are called the meridian points. In order for chi to course through the body unobstructed, there has to be a balance between the strengths of yin and yang. In ancient Chinese philosophy, yin and yang represent the forces of the universe- yin is for feminine, while yang is for masculine. Every single thing in the universe is believed to contain both yin and yang for harmony.",
            "When the yin and yang are not balanced, chi cannot stream through the body liberally. Therefore, the meridian points through which chi courses through need to be stimulated. This is done by the insertion of hair-thin, disposable needles in specific areas on a person\u2019s body to induce bodily harmony and bring about healing.",
            "A certified and trained acupuncturist will be able to carry out an excellent therapy session for the patient. Trainings for acupuncturists are given in order for them to obtain their licenses. A poor practitioner may not be proficient enough with the practice and could end up jeopardizing the results of the entire procedure. Nowadays, it is wise to verify on a practitioner\u2019s credentials to ensure a safe and effective acupuncture treatment.",
            "What This Ancient Method Does",
            "One of the foremost effects of acupuncture on the body is relaxation. Stress is frequently pinpointed as the main precursor for a host of physical ailments. There are particular points all over the body that direct the flow of harmony and relaxation and when these are enthused, the patient becomes more at ease.",
            "Another positive effect of this alternative therapy is increased pain control. During a session, a patient will usually feel very minimal pain as the thin needles are being inserted gradually. However, the needles are deliberately placed in varying depths, depending on the health requirements of the patient. When the needles reach the right depth, the patient will feel deeper pain, although the entire procedure is not necessarily painful.",
            "It is also recommended for relief from chemotherapy fatigue as well as chemotherapy-related nausea. It has also been found to be largely effective for back pains, migraines, menstrual cramps, and as a pain controller for patients after undergoing surgical operations.",
            "Variations of Conventional Acupuncture",
            "Auriculotherapy or ear acupuncture is one of the variations of conventional acupuncture. In this practice, it is believed that the ear provides a map for all the major bodily organs. A specific area or point on the ear corresponds to a particular organ, such as the heart, kidneys, or liver. Thus, the needles are placed in particular points around the ear and on the ear cartilage.",
            "Staplepuncture is a method used in smoking cessation, wherein staples are placed for a certain period anywhere on the ear area to provide stimulation.",
            "Indeed there is growing evidence that this traditional Oriental practice can rival any modern forms of treatment. If you are one of the many people who are looking for a widely recognized and time honored therapeutic practice, acupuncture may just be the alternative treatment for you."

        "content": [
            "Today's world can fill the very busy individual with a lot of stress. Without some way of removing this stress from your system, you're placing yourself in danger from a lot of stress-related diseases. You might suffer from insomnia or headaches or very serious heart diseases.",
            "You could take anti-stress pills to help you relax but, like me, you might also be worried about the side effects these pills could have. The good news is that you could try acupuncture at least once to see if it could help you manage the stress. It certainly couldn't hurt to try acupuncture if all you're after is stress relief.",
            "If you find it doesn't work for you, then you can just easily stop taking acupuncture treatments. If it works, though, then you can say you've found a good treatment for stress that doesn't rely on those dangerous chemicals and pills.",
            "How does sticking needles into your body help manage the stress?",
            "In traditional Chinese medicine, much of the treatments depend on an understanding of the balance in our bodies and its internal organs. The sicknesses we sometimes develop are seen to be caused by imbalances in our lifestyles and environment. Stress is also affected by this imbalance. That is why when there is something wrong with your body, you'd typically have less of an ability to deal with stress. You'd get more irritable and find it really to difficult to relax.",
            "By sticking these very thin needles past the surface of our skin, the acupuncturist stimulates nerves in our body. These nerves send signals to our brain and scientists believe that the brain then releases its natural painkillers into our system. This immediately causes a feeling of relaxation for many people.",
            "The needles could also help your body by stimulating its circulation. With the circulation between the organs of the body improved, a lot of the body's wastes could be cleansed properly. Your organs would also receive the full benefit of the oxygen from your lungs making its way into the cells of your body without any blockages. This makes your organs much healthier and leaves you feeling much better in the long term as well.",
            "You can think of a session with the acupuncturist as very much like massage therapy. A good massage would help give you a very relaxing sleep that night and an acupuncturist could help you with your sleep as well. You might immediately start to feel drowsy as soon as the right nerves are stimulated by the acupuncturist's needles.",
            "You might be asking yourself how you'd be able to relax if you're suffering from the pain of the needles attached to your body. What you might not realize is that because of the thinness of the needles, you would hardly feel anything. The most that many people claim they feel is a kind of tingling feeling where the needles are. And that is actually a sign that the process is working,",
            "Acupuncture is a practice that helps you use your bodies' own ability to manage stress properly. This leaves you healthier, and more importantly, prevents any of the serious diseases that could come from unbalanced, stressful lifestyles.",
            "It might not be something to replace regular trips to the doctor but with its many possible benefits, acupuncture might be worth trying out very soon."

            "Students who enroll in such courses will be taught through demonstration, discussion and hands on application.",
            "Part of the curriculum will also include basic courses in traditional medicine covering subjects such as anatomy, biosciences, medical terminology, herbal medicine, moxibustion, and acupressure. In some schools, they may require students to also learn about nutrition and various kinds of research.",

            "It doesn\u2019t matter if you are still in high school or if you are already working because a shift in your career could let you achieve your true calling.",
            "The best way to start though is to talk with an acupuncturist about what it takes to become one so he or she will be able to give you an idea of what happens in the job.",

            "We mentioned that you have to study in a school certified by the Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM). One more hurdle you have to face before getting your license is passing an exam given by them except in the state of California which has its own regulating body and board certification exam in order for you to practice your profession.",
            "An acupuncturist degree is just the first step in becoming your own boss. To become a master, you have to learn everything there is to know as a student so those who entrust themselves to you in the future will not have any problems.",
            "As more people are opening their minds to this practice, people should know that getting an acupuncture degree will not replace traditional medicine since there are limits to what it can do for the patient. It is merely a form of holistic healthcare that works hand in hand with science to help the person deal with an illness."

            "If, like me, you have quite a fear of needles and injections, then acupuncture, that practice of sticking needles onto different parts of your body to cure sicknesses might seem scary at first.",
            "However, if you've been long been suffering from some problems like headaches or chronic pains and your regular visits to the doctor don't seem to be helping you, then why not consider a trip to an acupuncture specialist? After all, who hasn't heard of somebody's aunt somewhere suffering from arthritis and trying out everything that the doctors recommended all to no avail, only to finally be cured by a really good acupuncturist?",
            "Perhaps you were wondering if it could actually work for you. You might feel a bit skeptical since traditional Chinese medicine doesn't immediately coincide with theories in modern Western medicine. In fact, the use of needles to cure people was discovered thousands of years ago in China long before microscopes or x-ray machines were invented or before bacteria and germs were discovered.",
            "When you think about it, that might be something that the practice has going for it. If it has existed already for thousands of years and is still being practiced by millions up to now, then it must have worked already for quite a number of people.",
            "What typically happens when you go to an acupuncturist?",
            "When you go to an acupuncturist, you would typically first be asked about your medical history, how you're feeling and any symptoms of sicknesses you might have. The specialist would observe features of your face, including your tongue. According to specialists, your tongue is a good indicator of the health of your internal organs. The acupuncturist would listen to sounds that your body makes like the sounds coming from your lungs. How your body smells could also be an indicator of your overall health for the acupuncturist's diagnosis.",
            "Based on what the acupuncturist finds out about your sickness, he or she would then formulate the treatment that your body needs. With traditional Chinese medicine, sicknesses are seen as a kind of imbalance and loss of harmony between your bodies' organs. You can consider the use of needles on your body as just a way to push your body and its organs back into balance.",
            "The specialist would begin inserting very thin needles into the right places in your body. To many people, inserting these needles doesn't really hurt. After all, an acupuncturist's needles are usually much thinner than the needles that are used for injections. Many have claimed that inserting these needles actually calms them down and relaxes them.",
            "How does the use of these needles help you?",
            "A lot of problems have been claimed to have been alleviated through this practice. These include headaches, the common cold, arthritis, back pains, asthma and even infertility.",
            "Even though acupuncture isn't part of Western medicine, Western medicine experts have studied it extensively. Some theories as to why it works involve acupuncture perhaps stimulating the brain's release of the body's natural painkillers. Acupuncture could also stimulate proper circulation in the human body.",
            "Western medicine is still studying acupuncture and trying to find out how to best integrate it with practices in Western medicine. That is why, along with Western medicine and trips to the doctor, one could certainly try acupuncture.",

            "In a generation when physical fitness is given topmost attention, people are always on the lookout for the newest and most effective means for weight loss. Acupuncture, the method of inserting thin, filiform needles on certain points in an individual\u2019s body, has been found to be one effectual method for losing weight.",
            "Not many people may find the idea of being inserted by needles quite comforting in their quest for weight control. However, this ancient Chinese alternative treatment seeks to deliver a control mechanism, enabling the patient to manage hunger cravings more successfully in the long run.",
            "The Skinny on Acupuncture Weight Loss",
            "It has been found that weight gain is directly related to emotions.  Other than physical hunger, people reach for a huge chocolate bar or a big platter of burger and fries because of the sense of comfort derived from food and eating. More often than not, excessive weight gain is an emotional issue, rather than a mere physical one. You may not realize it, but you tend to take in more food whenever you\u2019re stressed, upset, or pressured.",
            "In Acupuncture, there are specific spots on the body being targeted by the hair-like needles. These spots are linked to certain areas in the body and by stimulating these spots; the patient will achieve a greater sense of inner balance. As these points are inserted by the needles, certain hormones are released throughout the body. These substances work by helping you manage hunger and efficiently control the impulse to overeat.",
            "How Acupuncture Induces Weight Loss",
            "Most acupuncturists will target the spots behind the ear when it comes to promoting weight loss. When these points behind the ear are stimulated, endorphins are released in large doses. Endorphins are called the feel-good hormones, and these are also often referred to as natural pain and fever relievers. The release of endorphins is what makes you feel better after an increased level of physical activity, as in the case of a good workout.",
            "These bodily compounds allow the patient to experience better relaxation, thus considerably alleviating stress. There is a greater possibility of enhanced weight loss when the patient has already achieved emotional wellness. Endorphins are also released whenever the body experiences low levels of bodily pain, thus their moniker as a natural pain reliever.",
            "Patients of acupuncture typically experience very minimal or no pain at all, however most of the points are located near nerve endings and muscle tissues. As the needles are embedded in the body, signals are sent to the brain thus promoting the release of endorphins from the pituitary gland.",
            "There are also other points in the body that serve as gateways for better weight management. One of these placements promotes a decrease in an individual\u2019s appetite, while another has the ability to reduce water retention in the body. The acupuncturist may choose a multi-targeted approach, depending on the requirements of the patient.",
            "Consulting with a Professional Acupuncturist",
            "There are a number of acupuncture practitioners in existence nowadays, offering a host of services. If you are considering this form treatment for your weight management, make sure that you settle with no less than a trained and professional acupuncturist. A poorly trained acupuncturist may not be able to pinpoint the specific meridian points and worse, may cause unnecessary bodily pain and discomfort.",
            "Moreover, your acupuncturist may require an herbal supplement for your treatment, to encourage a longer-term effect. Your sessions need not be maintained for an extensive period; however you may be required to visit your acupuncturist during the entire course of the sessions.",
            "There are other means for losing weight successfully, and this does not include crash dieting and strenuous work outs. If carried out by trained professionals, acupuncture can be the answer for effective weight management. While it is far from being a cure-all, it may just be the right weight loss solution for you."

        "title": "Eight Myths About Acupuncture",
        "summary": "",
        "content": [
            "There are a lot of myths with regards to acupuncture. Some of these are true; others are silly while the rest only have a half truth. As you read on, you will learn which ones are worth believing.",
            "The first myth is that acupuncture is painful. This is not true because those who have tried it claimed they only experienced a tiny prick while others did not feel anything at all. There is no tissue damage when the needle is inserted into the skin or pulled out and only in very rare cases are there traces of bruising.",
            "The second myth is that you can get hepatitis or AIDS from acupuncture. This is true only if the needles used are not sterilized. In the US, this will never happen because acupuncturists are required to use disposable needles thus you are not at risk from these two diseases.",
            "Third, acupuncture is used to treat pain. This is only a half truth because this holistic technique has been proven to do other things such as stop a person\u2019s addiction, lose weight and prevent certain illnesses.",
            "Fourth, there are some who think that Asians are the only ones that can practice acupuncture. Since 1982, there are already 50 schools all across the country that teach students about this technique and become licensed acupuncturists.",
            "This means that anyone who has the desire to learn about this ancient practice can do so and help treat patients. Just to give you an idea, there are at least 3,000 acupuncturists now working in the US.",
            "Fifth, medical doctors do not believe in the potential of alternative medicine. This is not true because there are more doctors these days that are open to the idea that there are other ways to help patients aside from conventional medicine. In fact, some of them even recommend an acupuncturist if they know that what they have done is not effective.",
            "Another myth is that every patient will undergo the four needle technique. This is not true and it will only be used when the specialist feels that the energy of the patient is virtually not moving as a last resort.",
            "The seventh myth is that it is better for a medical doctor to perform acupuncture. This is wrong because the training is much different than that taught in medical school. Students who have an acupuncturist license train for 3,000 hours before they are allowed to practice this profession. So between an acupuncturist and a medical doctor, you should go with someone who has learned about this much longer.",
            "The eighth myth is that acupuncture is only used in third world countries. This is not true because this technique originated in China more than 2000 years ago and this has spread to developed nations in Asia such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.",
            "Here at home, acupuncture been practiced for more than 2 decades and is legal in 30 states. In fact 22 of them, license professionals after they graduate once they pass the state board examination.",
            "Although acupuncture has been around for a very long time, there is still a need for this form of holistic healthcare which is why this is being taught in colleges and in use today. It is painless and cost efficient and a lot of studies have shown that it is effective in treating various illnesses and preventing some of them."

            "Looking beautiful both inside and out is something we all want to achieve. Since your face is ridden with emotion and hormonal issues, you have to take care of it.

            "Facial acupuncture treatment needs to be done twice a week for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. For those who can\u2019t make two sessions in a week, they can opt for the 1 treatment that will last 90 minutes.",
            "After the regular sessions, it is advisable to go back for follow up treatment. It should be every 2 weeks for the next 2 months and then once a month later on.",
            "Aside from needles, most clinics use herbs in the form of masks, poultices and moisturizers. Before you use it, check with your doctor to make sure there is no allergic reaction to any forms of medication that you are taking.",
            "After the first facial acupuncture treatment, you will usually seen an increased glow to one\u2019s complexion which the Chinese say an increased Qi or blood flow to the face. It becomes more open, the wrinkles start to disappear and the skin appears more toned.",

            "The end result is that you will look and feel 5 to 15 years younger but of course this depends on how well the patient has taken care of themselves outside the confines of the clinic.",
            "To sum things up, facial acupuncture can do for you. It can eliminate fine lines and reduces wrinkles, improve your overall facial color and add luster to the skin, relaxes tension in the face and furrows in the brow, brightens the eyes and reduce dark circles and puffiness, improve muscle tone for sagging skin, enhance your natural radiance in the skin and eyes, slow the aging process within, promotes overall health and well being as well as relaxes and revitalizes the entire body.",

            "You should now that the 50 schools mentioned are all accredited by the National Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.  It is recognized by the Department of Education and some of these schools even have a masters program.",
            "Most of these schools can be found online so you can give them a call and ask certain questions about the school. You can find out the cost of tuition, the teacher student ratio, if the school offers consultation services to students and the alumni and if they have an extensive library which focuses on traditional Chinese medicine.",
            "Should there be a school near where you live, you should probably take it so you don\u2019t have to worry about boarding and lodging as this is just added cost to this long term investment.",
            "If you like the school but cannot afford the cost of tuition, find out if they offer scholarships or if they have a grant in aid program. If there are none, then check with the federal government because they should have one and they will give it to deserving students who plan to enroll in a school accredited by the National Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.",
            "Some states do not require you to get a license once you graduate from the program. However, if you plan to practice this elsewhere, you should prepare yourself for the state board exam as this is a requirement.",
            "The lists of subjects you will be learning in school include anatomy, body therapy, massage therapy and the other sciences. Training will be done also in a clinical setting so you are able to put theory into practice but this will only happen in your third year.",
            "While some schools will let you finish a program in three years, there are those that can be completed after five.",
            "Lately, acupuncture school has also gone down the digital path by offering cyber distance programs for those who cannot go to school. Some of these offer CEU\u2019s or continuing education units to advance programs.",
            "These courses can be chosen on the basis of modules or on an hourly basis. The course material covers the history, theory and techniques of acupuncture. Courses that offer tools such as acupuncture DVD and video are ideal for acupuncturists or students of acupuncture to improve their clinical expertise.",
            "Once you graduate from acupuncture school, some will open their own practice while others will first work for a clinic. Those who decide to be employed will work with other professionals that may include naturopaths, chiropractors and other specialists that are also into Oriental Medicine.",
            "The average acupuncturist makes about $45,000 a year but this can change in the years to follow as they add years or experience under their belt. This just goes to show that if you work hard, you too will make a fortune. Just make sure that you do this properly for each patient because one mistake could make this all go away."

        "summary": "",
        "content": [
            "With the growing acceptance of alternative medicine in Western cultures, acupuncture is quickly becoming a popular practice. More and more people today are choosing acupuncture over western medicine to treat bodily pains, relieve stress, or to promote overall health. If you are thinking about trying acupuncture but are wondering if it is safe or if it\u2019s the right treatment for you, the following information may aid you in making a more informed decision.",
            "Description and Origin",
            "Acupuncture is the practice of inserting fine needles into specific points in the body for therapeutic purposes. According to theory, these specific points called \u201cacupuncture points\u201d lie along pathways of the body along which one\u2019s vital energy is said to flow. The needles are used to promote free-flow of energy in areas of the body that circulation may have stagnated. Although acupuncture is practiced in many Asian cultures such as Japan, Tibet, and Korea the practice is commonly known to have originated in China.",
            "Acupuncture in the Western World",
            "One of the most debated issues between the East and the West is the use of acupuncture as a western means of medical treatment. Even though this form of medicine has been used as an effective method for over five thousand years in China, there is no concrete evidence from scientific research studies that have proven the healing properties of acupuncture.",
            "Skeptics shrug off the positive effects of acupuncture as merely placebo effects. Believers in acupuncture, however, say that the benefits have simply not yet been proven. Believers promote that the treatment is harmless and can be used as a complement to western medicine.",
            "Unfortunately, standards of acupuncture have not been fully approved by the FDA due to many unregulated practices that still exist such as the re-use of needles. Furthermore, acupuncture certification today is mostly a sham, used to make money on desperate patients who have not benefited from western medical treatments. The National Council Against Health Fraud has even declared acupuncture as an unproven means of treatment whose concepts of healing are primitive and false.",
            "Should You Try It",
            "One thing that Western science can agree upon is that there are no proven harmful effects of acupuncture. Many doctors agree that as long as a medication is not detrimental to one's health, then there is no reason why it should not be used if there are noticeable benefits. Most scientists would also state that it is simply due to a lack of research that the therapeutic properties of acupuncture have not yet been proven.",
            "Although many forms Chinese medication remain debated concepts in Western society, there is a growing interest in these medications and perhaps as the acceptance of the practice grows, so will the discoveries about its medical properties.",
            "More Information on Acupuncture",
            "You can find more information about acupuncture at an acupuncture center close to you. You can easily locate nearby centers or practitioners by searching online. An appointment may be necessary as acupuncture centers are usually busy with long wait lists.",
            "So if western medicine is not working for you and you are looking for an alternative, give some thought acupuncture. More and more people are discovering the therapeutic benefits of this ancient medicine. Acupuncture is safe and harmless, and therefore you have nothing to lose and everything to gain."

        "summary": "",
        "content": [
            "Acupuncture is already a renowned method used in treating smoking addiction. An alternative medicine believed to have originated as far as 3000 BC in ancient China, this treatment is now being widely utilized for various medicinal and therapeutic purposes. It has been found furthermore to successfully treat drug dependence and chronic smoking addiction.",
            "There are several smoking cessation medications and therapies available presently. However acupuncture is a recommended alternative procedure, especially where conventional therapies have already failed. The strategic insertion of needles in various parts of the body aims to treat the condition in a more profound and emotional level. A smoker needs to free himself from the physiological and psychological addiction of smoking, thus necessitating a more holistic treatment.",
            "How It Stops the Addiction",
            "The placement of needles is usually located behind the ear, or on the ear cartilage. This is where the calming effect takes place, curbing the patient\u2019s cravings for more cigarettes. People who have a smoking habit are bound to take up the nicotine stick more often whenever they feel stressed, bored, or depressed. Needles are also often inserted on the hand and wrists to promote a steadier flow of bodily energy. The feeling of relaxation will help an individual think twice about lighting a cigarette again.",
            "Furthermore, this treatment has been found to help an individual deal with the withdrawal symptoms better.  This alternative medicine promotes better tolerance to pain and discomfort during smoking cessation. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild to severe and may involve nausea, palpitations, and dizziness. Oftentimes, these same conditions will propel an individual back to his smoking tendencies sooner than later.",
            "Nicotine is the addictive and toxic substance present in a cigarette. This is the same substance that makes quitting a big challenge for most smokers. The nicotine that you get from smoking will attach itself to the pleasure areas in the brain, making it hard for you to stop. Without a steady stream of this substance, a smoker will tend to feel depressed and uncomfortable.",
            "People who have undergone acupuncture treatment reported that they no longer find cigarettes as tempting or as satisfying. Oftentimes, smoking would leave an awful taste in their mouths prompting them to stop their habit for once. Some patients would even resort to eating mints or lozenges to clear to get rid of the terrible aftertaste.",
            "According to skilled practitioners, approximately 7 out of 10 smokers will successfully extricate themselves from their smoking habit after 2 or 3 weeks. While the others are unable to quit totally, these smokers will be able to cut down on their cigarette consumption quite significantly.",
            "Treatment from Acupuncture Experts",
            "It is very essential for a patient to consult with a skilled acupuncturist. A more personalized service will be provided by an expert, as well as added counseling for the patient. Moreover, an acupuncturist may prescribe herbal supplements to aid the patient in quitting efforts.",
            "During treatment, filiform needles are inserted into specific points on the ear cartilage, as well as the hands and wrists. Normal procedures last for about 30 minutes. Body acupuncture can be used in combination with the ear and wrist needle placements. An acupuncturist may also utilize a mild electric current, to enhance the effect of the needles through the body.",
            "The greatest advantage of this ancient Oriental procedure is the absence of side-effects during and after treatment. Unlike smoking cessation medications and nicotine replacement therapy products, acupuncture does not employ chemically manufactured substances. There is also no risk of weight gain during therapy. In conjunction with helping a patient quit smoking, it can also curb appetite, thus reducing food cravings.",
            "If you have tried several methods in smoking cessation to no avail, perhaps it is high time you consider the alternative method that is acupuncture. With the right practitioner and the right frame of mind, there is no reason why you won\u2019t be nicotine-free before long."

            "First, you should not eat a large meal before or after treatment.",
            "You should also avoid over exercising, engaging in a sexual activity or consume alcoholic beverages 6 hours before and after treatment.",
            "Since the acupuncture session will last from 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on how often you have to go to the clinic, you better fix your schedule so you have time to rest.",
            "Chances are, you were consulting with a doctor prior to your visit to the acupuncturist. If there are any prescription medicines given, don\u2019t forget to take them.",
            "You will not feel any improvement after just one or two visits with the acupuncturist. Just the same, you should write this down so you can go back to the acupuncturist on your next visit and tell him or her how you felt during the previous session. Such feedback will let the specialist know what needs to be modified in the future to help you with your problem.",
            "The acupuncturist might give you some herbs to take as part of your treatment. Since you don\u2019t know if taking them will have any side effects with the medication you are taking, you should first consult with your doctor if it is safe to consume both.",
            "Women who are pregnant are also advised not to undergo acupuncture treatment. However, they can engage in that once the baby is born.",
            "How well the acupuncture treatment will go depends also on specialist who will be performing it. You have to take into account their years of experience and skill so they are able to make the correct diagnosis, finding the acupoints in the body, the angle at which the needles will be inserted and the techniques they know as there are different types of acupuncture.",
            "This brings us to asking ourselves how to find a skill acupuncturist. For this to work, we have to do ask our doctor if they can refer anyone. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to also do some research online. After all, there are about 3,000 acupuncturists all across the country so it won\u2019t be that hard to find one.",
            "Before you decide to have a session with them, talk to the acupuncturist to know their credentials. This will also give you the opportunity to find out how much do they charge as this can be from $45 to more than $100 per session.",
            "You can probably ask for the name and contact number of a previous client so you can ask this person how everything went. Remember, if it doesn\u2019t work out for you, don\u2019t be afraid to find someone else who can do a better job.",
            "The most important thing to do during the session is to relax. If you feel an itch or something, tell the acupuncturist. The same goes if you are nervous or experience a burning sensation so the specialist will take out the needles.",
            "Now that you know the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of acupuncture, you should ask yourself if this form of treatment is right for you. If conventional medication doesn\u2019t work, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to see how things turn out."

            "Whenever you are feeling pain and discomfort, you'd usually reach for your painkillers for relief. While they do relieve the pain, they also bring along side effects that comes with taking foreign chemicals into your body. As much as modern medicine has developed drugs that can relieve pain right off the bat, do you really think that the quick fixes you've been taking are actually good for your body? Why not try something safer and more effective like acupuncture.",
            "What is acupuncture?",
            "Acupuncture has surged in popularity for the last few decades as brought on by the recent health trend. Mostly known as a traditonal Chinese medical technique, acupuncture is seen as a homeopathic method of treatment. While alternative medicine does raise a lot of eyebrows for the scientifically-inclined, it does merit attention before being dismissed as a quack cure.",
            "Basic Procedure",
            "Basically, needles are inserted into the skin, each corresponding to one of the numerous pressure points located throughout the body. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, by inserting a needle into the pressure point, an acupuncturist can manipulate the flow of chi or life force, thus relieving pain and gradually treating the patient. While most would say that the whole chi thing is a bunch of nonsense, science has suggested that with the needles inserted, the body's natural painkillers called endorphins are released, thus helping with pain relief.",
            "Instruments",
            "Modern acupuncturists nowadays use disposable fine stainless steel needles that are 0.007 to 0.020 inches in diameter which are sterilized with either ethylene oxide or by autoclave. Since they are way finer than hypodermic syringe needles, being poked by these needles are relatively painless. The upper third of the needle is covered with either a thicker bronze wire or plastic to make the needle sturdier and easier to handle. The length of the needle and how far they are inserted is all up to the acupuncturist and his practised style of acupuncture.",
            "Example Of Treatment",
            "If a patient has a headache, he/she is diagnosed and is treated by stimulating the sensitive points located at the webs between the thumbs and palms. In acupuncture theory, these points are connected to the face and head and can be used for treatment of headaches and other ailments involved. Needles are then carefully inserted into the skin until the patient feels a twinge, which is usually accompanied by a slight involuntary twitching of the area. During this treatment, a number of things may occur.",
            "- Sensitivity to pain in where needles are inserted.",
            "- A hint of nausea during treatment in case of bad headaches.",
            "- Near-immediate headache relief.",
            "Evolution",
            "As an ancient method, acupuncture has crossed over into the modern age with implementations of technology and recent scientific findings. Electrical stimulation is now a common technique that is combined with acupuncture to produce more effective results. Also, acupuncturists combined this eastern technique with western methods to further enhance the treatment.",
            "Practitioners have eventually realized that leaning towards one school of thought can't propagate progress unless they are willing to move towards the future by looking towards other horizons as well.",
            "Reactions And Research",
            "Not everyone is impressed with acupuncture itself. Most western medical professionals have expressed either doubt or indifference to the oriental method while others have downright driven it down into the earth with criticisms and brutal skepticism. However, recent research shows the efficacy (or lack thereof) of acupuncture, and while more research has to be done, it has been proven to actually positively affect some, but not all, forms of ailments that it claims to cure.",
            "So as the doors open to a new age of acupuncture, give it a try when you feel the need for pain relief and you will not be disappointed. As the Chinese have used it for many centuries, so should we."

            "Acupuncture comes from two Latin words namely \u201cacus\u201d which means needle in English and \u201cpungere\u201d which means prick. Its history originated in China more than 2000 years ago and has evolved into various forms.",
            "Some of the techniques of acupuncture do not even use needles anymore. Vibrating objects, ultrasound and even the fingers of the practitioner have taken some of the work to make the person feel better.",
            "The history of acupuncture is first discussed in an ancient Chinese medical text called the \"Huang Di Nei Jing\" or The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine.",
            "But there have been a few who are skeptic as archaeologists have found a 5,000 year old mummy in the Alps with similar acupuncture points in the body. This gives some people the idea that it was used even before the Chinese did but sine there is no written text to prove that, no one is certain and credit to this ancient practice goes back to the Chinese.",
            "In the 6th century, this knowledge moved to Japan. In the 17th century, a man by the name of Waichi Sugiyama wanted to make this procedure painless for the patient so he developed the insertion tube, a small cylindrical tube through which the needle is inserted. Believe it or not, this technique is still being used today.",
            "But acupuncture only reached the US in the early 80\u2019s with the establishment of a regulatory board called the National Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. As a result, various schools have been built and those who want to become licensed acupuncturists are now able to practice their profession.",
            "Despite that, there were a lot of people who are not yet convinced on the positive effects of alternative forms of medication. It was only in 1995 that the US Food and Drug Administration decided to classify the needles used for acupuncture as medical instruments and assured the public that they are both safe and effective.",
            "To further promote acupuncture, the NIH or National Institute of Health in 1997 has stated that this technique is very useful in treating various health conditions.  These include ear, nose, throat, respiratory, gastrointestinal, eye, nervous system and muscular disorders. In some cases, acupuncture is able to prevent some of them from happening.",
            "This was further strengthened by the fact that the side effects of acupuncture are much less than that of conventional drugs that are being sold by pharmaceutical companies.",
            "So that people can avail of acupuncture, another recommendation by the NIH is for US companies to provide full coverage for certain conditions. If you do not quality, perhaps there is partial coverage which you should look up in your policy.",
            "But despite that, more research needs to be done to see its effects on other health related problems. Some examples of these include addictions, autism, chronic low back pain, migraines and osteoarthritis of the knee.",
            "If you look at the history of acupuncture, not much has changed since the needle technique used back then is still being used today. Even if various forms have developed through the years, one thing for sure is that it works.",
            "In order for you to see how effective it is, you have to see a specialist who is not only qualified to treat your condition but also one is well trained."

            "Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine that has been practiced for thousands of years.

            "Pain",
            "Acupuncture is most commonly known to treat bodily pains such as muscular pains and arthritis. There are many types of arthritis, and each have a different acupuncture procedure.

Acupuncture is thought to relieve stress and improve flow of energy that may be causing the depressive symptoms. Improvement in symptoms can be seen as early as the first session. Experts have found acupuncture to be a beneficial complement to other forms of depression therapy such as psychological counseling, and healthier than chemical alternatives such as anti-depressants.",

            "Acupuncture has become a popular alternative to common remedies such as sleeping pills. It works at the nerve levels, relaxing and soothing your senses. Acupuncture is thought to be a safer route for insomnia because it brings back your natural sleeping cycle through natural means and not through chemicals, which can turn into an addiction. Using acupuncture for insomnia usually starts working after the very first session. The treatment is usually stretched out for a period of time, until your body returns to its natural sleeping cycle.",
            "Infertility",
            "Studies show that acupuncture is a beneficial form of complementary therapy for women who are having undergoing treatments for fertility problem. Acupuncture is believed to relieve the anxiety of women undergoing fertility treatment. Also, acupuncture's success in aiding fertility is more pronounced in in-vitro fertilization. In addition, the rate of miscarriages has been found to be lower for women who do acupuncture.",
            "Others",
            "The following are other ailments that acupuncture has been known to remedy:",
            "\u00b7 Menopausal problems such as hot flushes, infertility, and premenstrual tension.",

            "Acupuncture has been practiced for hundreds of years. To let you know more about this practice, here are a few things that you should know.",
            "First, acupuncture is a holistic healthcare technique that involves inserting needles into specific points in the body. Studies have been conducted and it has been proven to treat ear, nose, throat, respiratory, gastrointestinal, eye, nervous system and muscular disorders.",
            "The needles used in acupuncture are very small and you will probably feel a slight twitch when the needle goes in. They will be inserted carefully to \u00bc or an inch in depth and will stay there from 45 minutes to an hour depending on the condition of the patient.",
            "If inserted properly, you should feel some cramping, distention, electric sensation or tingling which means that the treatment is working.",
            "Needles used for acupuncture especially in the US are clean because they are required to be disposable. This prevents any chance that those who go for treatment will be contaminated by a communicable disease like hepatitis or HIV.",
            "Given that this has been practiced for more than 2000 years, various styles of acupuncture have been developed. So, before you decide to go for a session, you should know what technique is used so they can explain to you what happens.",
            "When looking for an acupuncturist, you should also ask where they got their training, how long they have been in the practice and most importantly, what experience the specialist has had in treating the condition you are experiencing.",
            "They should also be able to present their credentials like where they graduated and their state board license. If you live in a state that does not require a license, make sure they have something to show which certifies that they can practice their profession like a document from the National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncturists.",
            "The duration of your treatment varies depending on the nature of your problem. Some are easy to fix compared to others especially if you are dealing with something long term. For instance, alcoholics and drug users may quit their vices after 3 or 4 months while those suffering from a disease like autism will take years as there is no know cure yet for the this illness.",
            "Before the needles are inserted, you need to undergo a physical examination and answer a few questions. There are risks involved even though it is a painless procedure because the needle might hit something vital inside but if the specialist is good, then there is nothing to worry about.",
            "You may notice a spot of blood when the needles come off. But if you are concerned about it, talk to your acupuncturist so he or she can prescribe something.",
            "Some patients will experience immediate relief after the first session but others will not experience anything at all. This is the reason that an average session should be done 12 to 15 times at least 2 to 3 times a week.",
            "If acupuncture works for you, then the only thing you need are follow up sessions. This can be done twice every 2 weeks or monthly. It is really up to you. But don\u2019t forget to also see your regular doctor so he or she can also monitor the progress of your condition."

        "content": [
            "There are different types of acupuncture. Whichever you decide to use, they are designed to do the same thing and that is to relieve pain or treat certain diseases.",
            "The first is called TCM based acupuncture. Here, it uses eight principles of complementary opposites to create harmony in the body. These include yin/yang, internal/external, excess/deficiency, hot/cold.",
            "Next is called French energetic acupuncture. This is often used by MD acupuncturists. Meridian patterns are emphasized here particularly the yin-yang pairs of primary meridians.",
            "Korean hand acupuncture is another as practitioners believe that the hands and feet have concentrations of qi, and that applying acupuncture needles to these areas is effective for the entire body.",
            "There is also auricular acupuncture where it is believed that the ear is a microcosm of the body. This means that acupuncture needles are placed on certain points on the ear so it can treat certain addiction disorders.",
            "Myofascially-based acupuncture is often utilized by physical therapists as it involves feeling the meridian lines in search of tender points before applying needles as this is where abnormal energy flows.",
            "Japanese styles of acupuncture referred to as \"meridian therapy,\" tend to put more emphasis on needling technique and feeling meridians in diagnosis.",
            "Impulses of electromagnetic energy can also be used as the body generates tiny but electrical discharges which influence the function, growth and maturity of certain types of cells. By inserting the needles in these areas, it stimulates and alters the neurotransmitters in the body thus making the patient feel better after treatment. This is also sometimes used for diagnosis and testing.",
            "There are also other forms of acupuncture that do not use needles. For instance there is sonopuncture that uses an ultrasound device that transmits sound waves to points in the body to treat a patient. Some practitioners use a tuning fork or other vibration devices.",
            "Acupressure is another. Here, the professional will use their hands to relieve the pain. This can be used on it sown or with other manual healing techniques.",
            "The number of treatments you will need depends on the patient\u2019s condition. On average this could be from 10 to 5 treatments and 2 to 3 times a week. How much it will cost also varies as this could be from $40 to $150. Some insurance companies and HMO\u2019s now cover that or partially so you should check if this is included in your policy.",
            "Anyone can try acupuncture to relieve pain or prevent one but many practitioners decline to see someone during pregnancy. But if you have already started, it is generally safe to do so until the infant is born.",
            "Some acupuncturists may ask you to take in some herbs as part of the treatment. Since you have no idea what it can do, have this checked first by your local doctor to make sure this is safe as this could interact with the drugs you are taking causing side effects.",
            "Which type of acupuncture should you try? That is up to you. All of them are effective so discuss this with your doctor and do some research so you know what you are getting yourself into. Each of these is painless so just relax and let the professional do the rest.",
            "Just like conventional medicine, don\u2019t expect an improvement overnight as this takes time so just keep an open mind."

            "The acupuncturist is the specialist who conducts acupuncture. He or she may use needles or some other instruments depending on the type that will be used to create harmony and balance in the body.",
            "Before this person does anything, you will first have to answer a few questions. You will then be given a physical exam to check your pulse and observe the shape, color and coating of your tongue. Other things that are checked will be the color and texture of the skin and your posture as this will give clues to your health.",
            "Only then will you be told to lie down on a padded examining table and the needles are inserted to the skin. The difference with this kind of needle is that they twirl and jiggle each time they are pushed further into the body.",
            "You may not feel them at all and if you do, it will only be a twitch that soon goes away. Once they are in place, this will be left there for 15 to 60 minutes that may make you feel very relaxed and sleepy that you may even doze off. Once the session is complete, the needles are removed and you will be on your way.",
            "In some cases, acupuncture is more effective when the needles are first heated. This technique is known as \u201cmoxibustion.\u201d Here, the acupuncturist lights a small bunch of the dried herb called moxa or mugwort and holds it above the needles. The herb, which burns slowly and gives off a little smoke and a pleasant, incense-like smell, will never directly touch your body.",
            "Another variation is electrical acupuncture. Here, electrical wires are hooked up to the needles and a weak current runs through it which may cause no or little sensation at all.",
            "It is also possible that herbal medications will also be prescribed by the acupuncturist for your treatment to be successful.",
            "When looking for an acupuncturist, make sure that person is licensed. Before he or she can obtain one, they have to complete 4 years of training at an approved college of oriental medicine. In the state of California, one governing body that gives the person the title is the California Acupuncture Committee.",
            "If they get this from another organization, a copy of their license must always be clearly displayed in the practitioner\u2019s office. One example is the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.",
            "When choosing an acupuncturist, there are a few things you should ask aside from their credentials. You should know what styles of acupuncture is used as there are some techniques that do not use needles to treat a patient.",
            "Although there are no studies which prove that one technique is better than the other, some patients are more comfortable with one type over the other.",
            "Another question you should ask and discuss further is the length of the treatment. Patients who are suffering from a chronic illness will have to be treated over a period of months before any improvements can be seen. This will help you plan your schedule since you need to go to the clinic 2 to 3 times weekly.",
            "The acupuncturist just like a medical doctor is there to help you get better. If you don\u2019t see any progress with this person, perhaps you should seek the help of another specialist."

            "The earliest account of this is found in the book called Nei Jing which in English means the Yellow Emperor\u2019s Classic of Internal Medicine. The contents of this book date somewhere around 200 BC. Back then, they did not use metal needles and instead used those made out of stone, moxibustion and herbs to treat a patient.",
            "Acupuncture prevents and treats diseases by inserting very fine needles into the skin specifically at the anatomic points of the body.",
            "The principle behind this concept is that illnesses occur because there is an imbalance in your life force otherwise known as Qi. It is believed that this flows in 14 channels in the human body known as meridians which branch out to bodily organs and functions. If there is a blockage or obstruction in any of them, this is when you succumb to a disease or an illness.",
            "The imbalance in the Qi may go one way or the other because of Yin and Yang. The person can only be normal if there is harmony between the two which is what acupuncture is trying to achieve. This can only be restored by stimulating these acupuncture points so your Qi can be adjusted, balanced and harmonized.",
            "Apart from using needles, practitioners also use friction, heat, impulses of electromagnetic energy and pressure to stimulate these points in order to balance the movement of energy in the body to reduce one\u2019s health.",
            "An example of this is sonopuncture where an ultrasound device that transmits sound waves is applied to these points in the body. Some use a tuning fork and other vibration devices.",

By inserting the needles in these areas, it stimulates and alters the neurotransmitters in the body thus making the patient feel better after treatment. This is also sometimes used for diagnosis and testing.",
            "According to the World Health Organization or WHO, here is a list of some illnesses where acupuncture is used. These include acute bronchitis, the common cold, cataract, toothaches, gingivitis, hiccups, ulcers, constipation, diarrhea, headache and migraine, Meniere\u2019s disease, osteoarthritis and a lot more. In the US, acupuncture is often used to treat chronic pain conditions and mind body disorders.",
            "But acupuncture is not risk free. Hematoma may develop if the needle punctures a circulatory structure. It is also possible that pneumothorax may occur if the needle is inserted too deep. There is also the risk of HIV and hepatitis if the needle was not properly sterilized.",
            "Now that you know what acupuncture is, you must not forget that it is merely an alternative and not a proper form of medical treatment. This means you should still be examined by a professional in the medical field who can determine the severity of your illness or disease."

Sometimes a child will be placed in a home, and then the child will be taken out of the home for various reasons. If you are thinking about adoption dissolution is because of an adoption that was more difficult then expected. Often adopting parents find out that they are unable to care for the child or have problems with the child. Sometimes a family does not mess well when there are current siblings and adopted siblings.",

Often you can get help with therapy, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t seem like anything helps to relieve the situation adoption dissolution is brought up. Most of the time the children are not bad, but there are medical or health issues that need to be dealt with but the adoption family is unable to give them the attention needed. Keep in mind that adoption dissolution is not always the answer to some of the family problems, but it is also not something that you should be ashamed about. All situations are different, but you\u2019ll find that adoption dissolution can work for some people.",

This is not a simple decision, as agencies provide many support services to ease the process, but they can also be costly. Plus, it raises even more questions: Where can I find an agency near me? How do I know if the agency is reputable? Do I choose a public or private agency? This article aims to answer some of these questions, or at least aide in finding the answers.",
            "First of all, there are two types of adoption agencies-- public and private. A public agency is run by the government (either state or regional) and supported by public monies. These agencies generally assist in the adoption of foster care youth. Private adoptions agencies, on the other hand are run by a private entity. They are licensed by the state in which they operate, but are funded privately. These agencies can be of assistance in all types of adoptions.",
            "A major advantage of using an adoption agency is that they do all of the \"searching\" for you. They will do the work of finding and matching a child to you, based on specified criteria. Support options are also generally available through adoption agencies, especially private ones. These services include counseling, referrals, and both pre- and post-adoption education. The downside to all of this is, of course, cost. It is estimated that an adoption can cost from $5,000 to $40,000.",
            "Adoption costs money, there's no doubt about that. However, when beginning the adoption process, you may encounter certain costs which should raise red flags. For instance, beware of any agency which requires payment of fees immediately after application. There will usually be a small fee up front, but otherwise proceed with caution. Do not deal with any agency that feels or has been reported to be disreputable.",
            "That being said, ask about costs upfront. There may be a sliding scale, and there are resources that exist to defray the costs of the adoption process.",
            "Another factor to consider is any specific focus which you would like the agency to take. Some agencies, for example, specialize only in placing bi-racial children, while others focus solely on children with special needs. Be sure to ask about any such emphasis before choosing an agency.",
            "Of course, before you can begin doing all of this, you must locate an agency in your area. Adoption.com maintains an online directory of adoption agencies across the United States, as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom. Here you can browse the clickable map, or search by state, category and agency name. There is also the option of selecting a country to adopt from internationally. The directory is available online at http://directory.adoption.com.",
            "This, of course, only answers a few of the myriad questions that people face when deciding to adopt. Prospective adoptive parents are encouraged to do as much research and ask as many questions as possible before beginning the adoption process. It can be a tedium of red tape, but in the end it is worth the struggle, and knowing the length of the struggle beforehand can make it that much easier."

I know your thinking, what is an adoption announcement?  Well I will tell you.  An adoption announcement is a lit like a birth announcement, but instead of saying something like, we are welcoming the birth of our child, it will say something like, we are welcoming into our family.",
            "There are all sorts of different kinds of adoption announcements.  Some people make their own announcements.  They say it is easier to make announcements than it is to find adoption announcements for older children.  Some people buy adoption announcements that contain pictures or have ribbon and bows.  Some have both.  Adoption announcements come in different languages.  They can include the name of the child, the child's birth date, where the child is from, such as what country, the day you met the child and the date the adoption was final.  They usually have the adoptive parent's names on it and any siblings.  The adoption announcement can also have the names of any pets.  Most adoption announcements include pictures.  Prices range from two dollars a piece to five dollars a piece, plus shipping and handling.",

There are no two announcements a like, just like there are no two children exactly a like.  Every thing is new and exciting when there is a child in the home, whether the child is biological or adopted, that child will always hold a piece of your heart.  Everyday will bring something new and exciting.  Not only will you be teaching your child but your child will be teaching you.  This is what makes parenting so exciting and also so terrifying.",
            "There is nothing more wonderful than having a child to call your own.  Adopting is a wonderful way to have this.  Adoptive parents have so much fun exploring and make things just right for their new children.  So preparing the adoption announcements should be just that, fun and exciting.",
            "First you should take into consideration the people that you will send the adoption announcements too.  That will give you an idea of what all should be contained in the announcement.  Weather they should be humorous or sentimental.  After you have your words chosen your layout picked and what style you want its time to shop.  Depending on how many you are sending bulk mail may be appropriate.  This is a good way to save money on postage.",
            "Many people also have welcome home parties after the adopted member of the family is settled in, while you are working on your announcements can be a good time to consider such a party where as you won't have to mail out separate invitations.",

To those who may not know what adoption photo listing is, it is where an adoption agency or the local Division of Social Services has pictures and information of children for adoption on the internet.  This is done to improve the chances of the child for finding a family.  There are more than 100,000 children in the United States in foster care and hundreds of thousands around the world in orphanages or substitute care.  All the children listed on photo listing are for adoption and need a permanent home.  Most of these children have special needs.  Many of the children are over the age of seven, and the majority of the them are much older.  These children have physical, emotional, mental and/or learning disabilities.  You will find several sibling groups that wish to stay together.  In all states you must have finished your home study before you can adopt.",
            "After reading the description of a child you can request more information.  Adoption Photo listing started in 1994 and over 8,000 children have appeared on it. The Adoption Photo list recieves more than two million hits per month.  Adoption photo listing is such a powerful way to motivate people even remotely interested in adopting.  Many people have a statistic in the back of their minds, knowing that there are millions of children around the world without a home.  But that's just it, it's just a statistic.  With adoption photo listing it is no longer just a statistic it is reality.  Adoption photo listing places a face where it used to be just a number.  Not only does it become a picture, but adoption photo listing describes the child.  It gives the Childs age, bithdate, state of residence, and the Childs likes and dislikes.",
            "Adoption photo listing is not only beneficial for the child wanting to be adopted, but also beneficial for the adoptive parents.  This way the child gets his or her face out there for more to see.  Also the adoptive parents have a chance to see pictures and learn about the children.  What the children look like, what they like to do, where they come from and sometimes an update on how the child is doing emotionally.  This give the adoptive parents more to go on than just a picture or even a number.",
            "Adoption photo listing is not just of children for adoption, but also of families or couples that want to adopt.  These adoptive parents have been thoroughly screened and have completed all of the prescreening assessments.  Many of them have fertility problems, making it near impossible to have children on their own.  These adoption photo listings give information such as the ages of the adoptive parents, when they where married, what their hobbies are and the information about any of the children they have whether they are biological or adopted.  They also explain how much they would like to adopt and raise a child, and how wonderful it would be just to be considered for adopting.",

There are some states that require more information such as dental history, immunization records, developmental history, and of course school records.  Some adoption Records also hold information on whether or not the child being put up for adoption is eligible for any state of federal adoption assistance.  Those states include: Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont.",

This information is gathered during a home study as well and it includes information such as the medical and genetic history of the family, the family and social background, a mental health history of the family, a religious background, and the level of education attained by the parents.  Some states require also the physical appearance, talents, hobbies, field of occupation, and a list of any drugs the birth mother toke during her pregnancy with the child.  There are a few states that if obtainable, will also provide the adoptive parents with the names, addresses and any other identifying information about the birth family.  These states are Colorado, New York, and American Samoa.",

Once a family has been chosen for a child they do a check on the family to make sure that the home will be suitable for the child being adopted.  The information that they collect is relatively simple.  When they do the home study for the adoptive family they include such things as a criminal background check, and they also check with the local child abuse registry.  They will also include the adoptive parents' physical health, emotional maturity, financial situation, and a family and social background.",
            "Montana seems to be the hardest state to adopt from, they ask for Employment history, history of drug and alcohol abuse, racial ethnic background, and a history of domestic violence.

Michigan, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, West Virginia, Puerto Rico, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Colorado, Illinois, Arizona, and the District of Columbia also ask for some of these items for the adoption records.",

If the adoption record is sealed it generally stays that way until the adopted child comes of age."

            "Adoption is a life-changing event for all involved, from the birth parents who make the brave decision to give their child up, to the adoptive parents who make an equally brave decision to welcome that child as their own. Yet one group which may go overlooked is that of the adopted children themselves. There are a number of issues that can arise for these individuals.",
            "If the child was adopted at a very young age, they may not even know they were adopted until adolescence, or even later. A possible conflict in identity may result, as these children have spent so much time in an identity which they may perceive to no longer be valid. Children who were adopted late enough in life to be cognizant of the process can have their own issues, as well, perhaps wondering why their original parents didn't keep them, or having trouble accepting their adoptive parents as legitimate. Children adopted by parents of an ethnic, racial, or cultural group other than their own often face a unique conflict as they try to reconcile the two identities internally.",
            "It has been shown that adult former adoptees suffer from a number of problems, including struggles with identity, low self-esteem, and feelings of abandonment. These underlying troubles may lead to further struggles like alcohol abuse, marital difficulties and depression. Many adult adoptees will also seek out information about their own genetic histories, spending years trying to find siblings, parents or any other biological relatives. The upshot of these issues is that they are nothing new. They are so frequently encountered that they are known about and there exist mechanisms to help these individuals cope.",
            "One option is to find a support group. The mere act of connecting with a group of people who have had similar life experiences and dealt with similar issues can be beneficial in itself. The clich\u00e9 is that misery loves company, and in this case it's true. Seeing that others are going through some of the same things is reassuring. Support groups provide a forum in which former adoptees can discuss their experiences and confess their troubles. National support groups such as ALMA and the American Adoption Congress are good resources for adult adoptees.",
            "Individual counseling is another option. Some counselors and therapists specialize in adult adoptees. Some of these professionals are adult adoptees themselves. The therapeutic intervention can treat a number of aspects of the adult adoptee experience. Therapy can help the individual in their interpersonal relationships, help them heal from lingering feelings of abandonment, and even assist in the search for birth parents (which can be a cathartic solution in itself). This kind of counseling can be costly, but some counselors offer group sessions, which may combine some of the advantages of support groups and individual counseling.",
            "For the adopted individual, adoption is a lifelong experience. It does not end when the adoption is finalized, nor at the onset of adulthood. It is something that adoptees carry around throughout their lives, and as such it must be addressed and coped with. Fortunately, there are resources for these individuals. For those struggling with issues like those described above, a good starting point is www.adopting.org, a website with resources geared to all people touched by adoption, including adult adoptees."

            "In sports, there pundits who oppose using statistics alone to measure a player's performance. They say that these numbers only tell part of the story and fail to capture certain intangible aspects of the game that cannot be quantified. This is particularly true of adoption statistics, which are unfortunately incomplete. There is no one body which tracks adoption statistics, leaving what numbers are available scattered somewhat outdated. Useful figures can still be found, however, and serve to paint part of the adoption picture.",
            "Perhaps one of the more striking numbers is the number of Americans who are personally touched by adoption in one way or another. A study done in 1997 by the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute found that 60% of Americans had an adoption experience. As defined by the authors of the study, this means that either the participant or one of their family members or close friends had adopted, had placed a child for adoption, or was adopted. Although the research is ten years old, it's still quite interesting, as its findings mean that people who have been affected by adoption compose a majority in the United States.",
            "Another tale is told by examining the demographics of women who place their children for adoption prenatally. As it turns out, the likelihood that a woman will place their unborn child has an inverse relationship with socioeconomic status (SES) and level of education within the birth mother's family. For example, if a woman's mother completed at least one year of college, then she is statistically three times more likely to place a child for adoption than a woman whose mother did not finish high school, according to one study. Researchers explain such trends by claiming that these women come from families which are generally more supportive than those of women from lower SES and educational backgrounds. One California study bucks this trend, however, finding that women who placed their children tended to not have an education beyond high school.",
            "It was stated above that most of the extant statistics pertaining to adoption are inaccurate or outdated. As with all things, however, financial records remain meticulous, allowing for an accurate estimate of the costs of adoption. The biggest factor influencing adoption cost is the kind of agency of involved. A domestic adoption via a public agency may cost as much as $2500 down to nothing at all. On the other hand, that same adoption when handled by a private agency can cost as little as $4000, or upwards of $30,000. The difference is due largely to the fact that public agencies are subsidized by the state, and private agencies often offer more support services which can be costly.",
            "As stated above, these statistics paint only a small part of the picture of adoption. They are merely descriptive, and do not necessarily predict future adoption figures or trends. They do however, provide a certain degree of insight and can be useful for those considering either adopting or placing a child for adoption."

This is not always the case.  Unfortunately there are several children who do not get adopted and age out of the systems at age eight-teen.",
            "Whether Americans have any experience with adoption, not everyone understands it or supports it.  The history of adoptions can be traced back as far as the 18th century BC.  Adoption was very common during the Ancient periods, and generally involved adults not children.  These adults where used to carry on family heritage or to protect property rights.  It has been found that both men and women whether married or single could adopt.  Our modern adoption laws find heritage in the Hammurabi Code of the 18th century BC.  Ancient Times focused on adoption of adults, while during the Middle Ages it focused on children and set some good ground rules.  In Ancient Times, the adoptions where merely saying that you wanted someone to follow in your footsteps.  During the Middle Ages there were specific laws put into place to protect the child and all adoptions during this time period where handled by the court systems.  The first state adoption was in 1851 in Massachusetts.  In 1853, Rev. Charles Loring Brace founded a children's aid program to help orphaned and abandoned children.  His solution was to get the children off the streets and send them to strong Christian homes.  These children where gathered up and placed on trains bound for the mid-west.  At each stop the children where displayed for all to see, and who ever was not chosen was placed back on the train to go to the next stop.",
            "Things have certainly changed since then.  But one thing has remained the same, we still want what's best for the children.  Even though sometimes it's hard to know what's best.  Adoption has become a wonderful thing and has been a good chance for children without a home for centuries."

            "A frequent question among those people looking to become adoptive parents is that of what the children are like. This is understandable, of course. After all, before welcoming a child into one's home, it is useful to know what options are available and what one can expect of the child. Since all children are different, there is no single or precise way to answer this question. By examining the various kinds of children who are generally adopted, it is possible to paint something of a general picture.",
            "One option is to adopt an infant born within the U.S. The infants placed for public adoption are generally African-American, Hispanic or mixed-race. The number of Caucasian infants placed for public adoption is relatively small in comparison, as these children are generally handled by private adoption agencies. Adopting an infant is preferable for those people who wish to raise their adopted child from a very early age, possibly to simulate the experience of raising a birth child. Because this is such a widely sought option, it can often be difficult to find a readily available child, often resulting in long waiting periods before being able to adopt.",
            "A second domestic option is to adopt a child who is already in foster care and waiting for a family. These children tend to be older, from grade school age up to adolescence. They may have special needs, such as emotional, mental, or physical disability, or they may be part of a sibling group that must be placed together. Often called \"waiting children,\" these special cases are handled by both public and private adoption agencies, with entities called adoption exchanges helping to provide matches between child and parent. Often, adoption subsidies are available to help offset the cost of caring for a child with special needs.",
            "A third option is to adopt internationally. Children are available for adoption in over fifty foreign countries. These children have been put for adoption for a variety of reasons, often linked to the nation or culture in which their parents live. In South Korea, for example, unwed mothers are looked upon shamefully, so would-be single moms often put their infant up for adoption. Often these children are living in orphanages, just waiting for someone to adopt them. The process of adopting from abroad can be a tedious one, but there are agencies and attorneys that will facilitate the process.",
            "No matter which option is right for a certain individual, one theme remains the same: there are children who need to be adopted. From infancy to adolescence, both at home and overseas, there are children who are without families. For prospective birth parents who do not have the means to raise a child, and for people looking to start a family, adoption is a solution to be considered. If you or someone you know is thinking of adopting and would like some more information, some good online resources include Adoption.com and Adopting.org, both of which are aimed at providing information on adoption to pertinent parties. AdoptableKids.com is an online adoption exchange where one can search and browse photo listings of hundreds of kids currently waiting to be adopted."

Sometimes she gets to run in wide open spaces, like at the park, sometimes she runs alongside her mom's bike, and sometimes she just runs back and forth through the house. To her, it doesn't much matter, just as long as she gets to run. The way her life started out, however, it was possible that she might never have gotten the chance.",
            "Paloma is a one-year-old half English setter/half English pointer mix. Her name, which is Spanish for \"dove,\" was bestowed upon her because as a very young puppy, she was entirely white. The result of an accidental breeding between two show dogs, Paloma and her six sisters were unexpected and unwanted by the owners of both parent dogs. Fortunately, all seven dogs made their way to a pointer rescue shelter, and have since all found happy homes.",
            "Paloma's story is not a unique. Thousands of dogs across the country are in need of rescuing and go unadopted. Often these animals spend the rest of their lives in shelters, colloquially known as \"the pound.\" Those that are not cannot be adopted are euthanized. The reasons these dogs wind up in shelters vary. Some of them were bought as Christmas presents for a child, but soon the parents had second thoughts as it became clear that the puppy might be more trouble than they anticipated. Others ran away and were picked up by animal control or the local human society, but went unclaimed by their owners. Still others had to be given up due to their owner's allergies or other health problems. Yet most of these dogs still have plenty of years of companionship and affection left in them, and would love nothing more than to be taken in by someone who will love and care for them.",
            "Some people may be hesitant to adopt a shelter dog, for fear of health or behavior problems. While some dogs may have behavior problems as a result of being abused or neglected by their previous owners, not all shelter dogs are like this, and those that are can usually be re-trained by someone who happens to be particularly patient. Dog lovers are encouraged to ask questions about a dog's background before adopting, in order to avoid potential problems and frustrations. Nearly all shelters will not allow a dog to be adopted until any health problems have been successfully treated. Any information on treatment of chronic conditions or other special needs will be passed on to the new owner.",

Adoption is often cheaper than buying a puppy, and the dogs are just as friendly and loving, if not more so. Plus, most are already housebroken! To get started on the search a new best friend, call your local humane society or search online at PetFinder.com."

You can find dog adoptions through a shelter, rescue group, or through a non-for-profit organization online.  Dogs end up in shelters for many reasons, such as its owner dies, someone has to move or their financial situation changes, a dog is lost and can not find its way home, a person develops health problems and can no longer care for the dog, or develops allergies.  The Humane Society of the United States estimates that three to four million dogs and cats are euthanized every year, due to a lack of homes.",
            "The adoption process for dogs is fairly simple and can take anywhere from thirty minutes to two days.  To adopt a dog you will need to fill out an application and a questionnaire.  If both are accepted the shelter will call any landlords that you might have, to make sure you can have the dog where you live.  If this checks out then in some cases, someone will come out to your home and make sure you have an adequate home and yard for the dog to live in.  Once this is complete you will be asked to pay an adoption fee, ranging from $50.00 to $350.00.  Then the dog will be spayed or neutered before going home.  There is no exception to this rule, it is a must.  Two to three days after surgery you will be able to pick your new pet up and take it home.",

There is a big difference in dog personalities, so depending on what the dog will be primarily for is depending on what bread you will want.  You should also remember that not all dog breads are good with children and some breeds are not good with other animals.  Where as allot can be told by breeds or what breads make up the mix, each dog will have its own personality.  The temperament varies, and is unique to each individual dog.  Most places that do dog adoptions will allow you a visitation period, some will even require it.  This is a good idea and should be taken advantage of.  Spending time with a potential dog will tell you volumes about their individual unique personality.  This can also clue you in on weather or not they will be good with children and other animals.",

If your shelter offers a visitation it should be taken advantage of, bring your children and any other pets that you might have.  Check with you local shelter and rescues to find out what they require as far as adopting a dog.  You might also ask them what their fees are and if they offer animal visitation.  Once you have done the research then you can begin your process of a dog adoption."

            "There are a whole lot of dogs out there up for adoption, the good news is that a lot of them would probably fit into your unique situation well. The bad news is there are several that probably will not. Let's start with breed. Weather it is a pure bred Dog you want to adopt or a mix breed you can generally tell how big it will be and a few things about its general temperament by some simple breed research. While you can't learn everything about that particular dog you can learn quite a bit about the kind of dog that you would want to adopt. Certain breeds are said not to be as good with children as others however, some of those very same breeds are better at home security. So again it comes down to what it is that you want out of the dog you are trying to adopt.",
            "Size can also be told by breed, or at least guessed at by what breeds make up your mix.  Some dogs for adoption should only reach five pounds where others may grow well over two-hundred and five. So If you are looking for a large dog you should look into larger breeds such as, Great Danes, Rottwillers, Saint Bernard's, Great Pyrenees, Labradors and so on. If your individual needs require a smaller companion than maybe a medium sized dog say around thirty to sixty pounds is what you are looking for in the dog that you adopt. In that case maybe you should look into breeds or mixes that include some of the following: Collie, Sheperd, Spits, Spaniel, Boxer, or chow just to name a few. Though sometimes they are considered more hyperactive your dog adoption needs require a small dog to adopt. In this case you may want to look at breeds such as, Tea cup poodles, Daushound, Papillion, Bichon Frise, Pomeranian, and so many others in the miniature category.",
            "The age of the dog that you are to adopt can also be of great importance to a person. With age comes some benefits, generally they are already house trained or are outside animals that have grown accustom to life that way. An older animal will be less likely to steal your slippers as a chew toy, or eat the paper rather than bringing it to you. Puppies on the other hand can be a hand full, however you get to decide how they are trained and what things the can and can't do in your house from day one. Though they generally learn fast, they require much more time and attention than an older animal. Puppies have more energy and less control they need constant supervision, and lots of loving attention. The payoff for all your hard work is a very attached dog that will be loyal. There are pros and cons to any age dog that you chose to adopt, the choice is really about what fits your situation.",
            "The process is quite simple and will require a small adoption fee. In some cases you will be required to submit an application so that you can be verified as a good pet owner. It is recommended that you visit with the dog on site, if you have children bring them with you so that you can see how the dog will interact with them. All in all adopting a dog is a rewarding adventure."

If you are sure that you can spend the time and money on a dog then you should check with your local animal shelters for your free dog adoption.

Do not do a free adoption because you are unable to buy a dog.  Do a free dog adoption because you want to welcome a homeless dog into your home and your heart.",

Then you need to go and start looking for the right dog for you.  Now remember that this may take more than one trip.  Once you have found the right dog it will be time to start the application process.  You may also be required to do a home study so to speak.  This is where someone form the shelter comes to your home and makes sure that your yard and home are adequate for a dog.  Once the application process is finished you will be required to pay the veterinarian fees and then you can take you new dog home."

Americans adopted roughly 3,783 children from Guatemala in 2005.  With Guatemalan adoption there is no travel required.  They also accept single parents.  Before adoptions are approved a DNA test is required by the United States.  This is done to prove the mother-child connection.  Six months of supervision is also required after adopting from Guatemala.",

Guatemala started doing international adoption at the end of their thirty-six year Civil War.  The war ended officially in 1996.  The reason the United States requires DNA testing of the child and the birth mother is because there have been rumors of babies being stolen and sold or place for adoption.",

Once you have chosen the right referral for you, the adoption agency will contact Guatemala and let them know which child you have chosen.  A Guatemalan attorney will then collect the consent forms, medical records, and birth certificate.  The United States will do the necessary DNA testing.  Once all this is done the attorney goes to court for you to finish the adoption.  He then gets the Childs passport ready.  When all the paperwork and court hearings are finished you have the choice to either go to Guatemala and pick up your child or have the child escorted to you.",
            "In Guatemalan adoptions you can be married, or single, meaning single men and single women can adopt.  The only real requirement is that the adopting parents be under the age of fifty years old.  Referrals generally start around three to six months after your paperwork has been received.  Once you accept a referral it takes about eight months for the adoption to become final.",
            "An international protocol was endorsed by law makers, because the United States said they will stop allowing American parents adopt Guatemalan children.  Guatemala has been told that it needs to make provisions of its secret systems.  These systems have been criticized due to high adoptive cost and for payment being made to the women and young girls placing their children up for adoption.  Guatemalan adoption is still probably on the better choices for single adoptive parents due to the flexibility of their current protocol.  Also with private lawyer's currently still in charge of a great deal of the process, this is also a good alternative for people currently turned down for domestic adoption."

            "When choosing to adopt a child, some prospective parents make the decision to partake in an international adoption. That is, they choose to adopt a child from a country other than their own. This process can be long and full of bureaucratic red tape, especially since it is a matter conducted entirely between the potential adoptive parents and a foreign court, which acts on behalf of the foreign government. The United States government cannot intervene on the parents' behalf. There a few reasons and some benefits to this option, however.",
            "Aside from the usual reasons for which one would choose to adopt, there are a couple of reasons why international adoption specifically may be a preference. One reason can be benevolence. The major countries from which children are adopted into the United States all have glaring social problems which drive the international adoption process. China, for example, has strict population control laws which often force Chinese parents to give their children (especially girls) up for adoption. Russia suffers from poverty to such an extent that raising a child is often not feasible. Americans who adopt children from these environments and others like them may decide that they wish to rescue a child from such circumstances and bring him or her into the home.",
            "A second-- and perhaps more substantial-- reason for international adoption is the decline in availability of children for adoption in the United States. The number of adoptions which were conducted transnationally has more than tripled in the last 15 years, due largely to a decrease in potential adoptees available domestically.",
            "The potential benefits to the adopted child are fairly obvious. She is raised in a nurturing home by people who wanted the child so badly that they went to great lengths and expense to adopt her. In nearly all cases, the child moves up in socioeconomic class after being adopted. The child may also experience educational opportunities which may not have otherwise been available. While these benefits may be obvious, there are more complex and perhaps more obscure impacts on the societies and cultures involved at both ends of the adoption process.",
            "For those interested in international adoption, there are a number of resources available. First of all, it is advisable to first learn about domestic open adoption and explore domestic options before looking abroad. There can be certain risks associated with international adoption. That said, there are many children available in more than fifty countries, all of whom who are legally free for adoption and are in need of caring homes.",
            "One good place to start on the journey toward adopting a child from abroad is the website Adoption.com. The site has a great number of resources to answer all questions adoption. They have a section of the site devoted solely to international adoption (http://international.adoption.com). The United States State Department also has some information about intercountry adoption available online (http://travel.state.gov/family/adoption/adoption_485.html). This page clarifies the role that the U.S. government may be able to play in the adoption process, as well as providing phone numbers to call for more information on international adoption.",
            "A final word: international adoption is a long process full of bureaucratic hurdles. It can be costly and may require prospective parents to reside in the country of the child's origin for a period of time before the process is complete. Like all things that require effort, however, people who endure the process ultimately find it to be worthwhile."

            "International adoption offers may benefits and a few hardships.  The pros of international adoption are as follows: there are a lot of children to be adopted of both sexes, from infancy and up in age.  Once you have an accepted home study you are all but guaranteed a child.  With international adoptions you know how long it will take (usually around twelve to eight-teen months).  The natural mother will not change her mind, all the children for international adoption are orphans.  Once you agree to a referral you will become the parent of that child.  You will know in advance how much all the fees are.  You will get to travel to another country.  The cons are as follows: you will not get a newborn; most infants are at least four months old.  The Childs heritage and medical information is not always known.  The child might have development problems, but should bounce back quickly.  There is a ton of paperwork required.",
            "International adopting means that we have to follow the rules and laws of our country and the country that we are adopting from.  Every country has conditions like age limits, income guidelines, number of children in the home, maritial stability, and gender (single applicants).",
            "The steps for an international adoption can be difficult.  First you need to decide what country in which you would like to adopt.  You should think about the cultural differences and weather or not you can really deal with them.  Consider your family and friends, talk with them and ask them what their opinions and thoughts on the matter might be.  You might ask them how they might feel about it.  You age and marital status will help you know what countries you can adopt from.  Once you have done that then you can narrow it down to one.",
            "Once you have chosen a country, you will need to choose an agency that can help you along the way.  You should remember when choosing an agency you need to feel comfortable about the people that you will be working with.  You also need to make sure that the agencies you are looking at handle international adoptions.  Once you have picked your agency it is time to start the paperwork.  The agency will assign a social worker to your case.  The social worker will come to your home and interview you and any children in your home.  They will also want to interview your friends and family.  This is called an international home study.",
            "Once the home study has been accepted, it is time to start collecting paperwork for your dossier.  All this is, is a collection of paperwork.  A dossier is a requirement for international adoptions.  All documents must be signed and notarized and then sent off to be translated and approved.  Once the dossier is finished and accepted you should start receiving referrals of children for adoption.  Now all you have to do is accept a referral.  You're almost done.  It is time to travel to the country you're adopting from for court, and then usually ten days after court you get to bring your child home to meet their new family."

Whatever your particular taste, when shopping for a new pet, consider adopting an animal from a shelter as an alternative to high priced pet stores. One convenient way to do this is to use a website like PetFinder.com. The selection is fantastic, and you can search without having to leave the house!",
            "An advantage to beginning the pet search online is the powerful search tools at your disposal. At PetFinder.com, for instance, a search function allows users to narrow down animals based on breed, age, size, gender, and range (i.e., how far the animal is from the person searching). Looking for a female Shih Tzu near Montclair, NJ? There are well over 100 listings on PetFinder.",

After all, part of the experience of owning a pet is raising and training it as your own. But while puppies and kittens are awfully cute, they are also a handful. They require a lot of work, training and patience. They have more energy than you may have ever though possible, and they are in constant need of attention. For some, the joy of a baby animal is worth enduring these difficulties. For those who want an animal but not the aggravation, mature pets are the way to go. A lot of the animals on pet adoption websites are from shelters, so there are plenty of adults available...but there are also plenty of adorable puppies and kittens who need homes, too. Whichever is your preference, you will be able to find it online.",

The animal's location, breed, general age, gender and name are listed right on the results page. There are also icons that give any special housing needs, such as for animals who need to be in a home without small children or other animals. When you see an animal you like, click on its name to read more about it. From there, it's just a matter of a phone call or e-mail to initiate the eventual process of adoption.",

There are a variety of ethnicities such as Asian, Gypsy, Mediterranean, and Caucasian.  Children of both sexes are available, but there are more boys than girls.  Russian children will remain on the adoption list for six months before being considered for international adoption.  This way they have a chance to be adopted by a Russian family.  Many of the children in Russian orphanages come from teenage pregnancies, although a few are truly orphans.  A handful of them are there because the families couldn't afford to care for them.",

The Russian Government began a review in 2005 of international adoption procedures, and changes are expected.  Fees range from agency to agency but are usually somewhere around $19,900 to $25,500.  This does not include travel, immigration filing, visa, document preparation or collection.",

You should research the different agencies and request information packets from the ones that you might be interested in.  In Russia only married couples or single women can adopt.  They believe the woman to be the main caregiver.  Once you have chosen an agency, you can begin you journey for a Russian adoption.  The entire Russian adopting process usually takes about nine months.  You start by doing a home study.  The home study is basically a report on what the social worker has found out about the adoptive parents.  Once you have finished the home study you will have to complete the Dossier.  This is paper work that the Russian Government requires.",

Most countries require that the notary's commission be valid for at least a year past the date they witness a signature.  When the paper work has been gathered and notarized, your agency will send it to Russia to be translated and notarized, and then they will give the paper work to the Russian authorities.",

They used to just send you a picture and travel information, but in April of 2000, Russia changed the regulations to include that the adopting parents must receive their referrals personally, before the Russian Ministry on Education.  When you receive your referral it should include a video tape of the child and any medical information on the child.  If for some reason you are not happy with the referral, then your agency should work with you until you are happy.  Once you are satisfied with your referral your agency will contact the Russian authorities to prepare the documents for the child being adopted.  When the paper work is finished your agency should then contact you and let you know of your departure date and any travel information that you may need to know.  Once you agree to a referral, families will take two trips to Russia.  Most adoptive children are ready within six months of finding a family.  Trip one is usually five to seven days.  Usually one month after agreeing to the referral.",
            "Families generally wait two to four months between the first and second trip.  The second trip is usually about ten days.  The adopted child will be able to go home ten days after the court hearing.

            "One form of same sex adoption is called \"second parent adoption,\" in which one partner can adopt the biological or adoptive child of the other partner without terminating the parental rights of the parent. So, theoretically, one member of a same sex partnership could adopt a child as a single parent. Then, the other partner could adopt the same child, essentially making each partner a parent to the child. This process would not work in Florida or Utah. The former forbids adoption by a homosexual, and the latter does not allow adoption by anyone in a cohabiting relationship that is not a legal marriage. Oddly enough, single people may adopt in Utah.",
            "Second parent adoption within same sex partnerships is explicitly permitted in the states of California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington, as well as in Washington, D.C. In the remaining 38 states, however, any laws regarding adoption by same sex couples are ambiguous at best. With the legal status of civil unions and same sex marriages being pushed to the forefront as a social issue, it may only be a matter of time before these ambiguities and obscurities are shaken out.",
            "Much of the reason for the lack of explicit language on same sex adoption is that it is relatively new as a social issue, at least within the public consciousness. Another reason is because it is often seen as such a controversial subject. It is a hotly contested issue, with firmly held opinions on each side.",
            "Some opponents object to gay adoption on moral grounds. They feel that homosexuality is amoral in itself, and so adoption by homosexuals is amoral by extension. They may also believe that participants in same sex relationships cannot perform as well as parents as traditional heterosexual parenting units. Several organizations, among them the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics hold that homosexual couples are just as qualified to be parents as heterosexual couples.",
            "There are others who fear that being raised by a same sex couple will influence a child to be homosexual, or that there may be a detrimental effect on the child's overall well-being. Research has shown that this is not the case, however, as the sexual orientation of parents is not related to that of their children and that children of same sex couples perform just as well on several measures of overall well-being. What's more, a study conducted UCLA estimates that disallowing adoption by LGBT couples can cost the United States between $87 million and $120 million annually. Researchers say this is because these couples are often willing to adopt children that heterosexual couples are not, such as older children, children with behavioral problems, and children who are HIV positive. If these children go unadopted, the financial strain of their care falls on the foster care system, sapping government funds.",

Many same sex couples are finding it more and more difficult to adopt and instead turn to insemination or sera get mothers.  Some states allow one parent to adopt and then the second parent to do a domestic stepparent adoption.  There are no international adopting countries that allow same sex couples either and if you gay or lesbian and single, if you keep your sexuality under wraps you may have better luck adopting.  In Massachusetts, California, and Vermont, where same sex marriage is legal, they still recommend that the second parent file for stepparent adoption.  This way the federal government will recognize the legality of the parent-child relationship.",

None of the steps are different, only getting those accomplished takes some breaking through taboos and stereo types.  In general a lot of red tape.  In some cases things tend to go right through when the judge is on your side, if he or she is not then there could be friction there too.",

Gay and lesbian couples will still be able to adopt after overcoming the challenges of their sexual orientation.  And though little is known about how same sex parenting impacts a child raised in these circumstances, one could scrutinize that many have adopted already, and there are a lot of well adjusted children living in those situations, or it would not still be allowed."

The process is rather simple and generally requires an adoption fee and sometimes a pet owner check.  This helps them to know what kind of pet owner you have been in the past.  It is always a good idea to spend time with the dog before you adopt it.  If you have children you should bring them along for the first orientation.",

Some of the more popular breads such as, bichon frise, Papillion, miniature pincher, dashound, Yorkshire, pug, Boston terrier ect.. Have bread specific rescues.  Other rescues are more general and have mixed breads as well.  If after you have finished your research, you found that particular bread fits you better, this avenue would probably work best for you.",

The smaller breads are too easy for a small child to hurt.  This can happen by falling on them or stepping on them.  Also some small dog breads are more likely to nip and bite.  Small dogs should be adopted into a home where there are older people or a family with older children.",
            "Small dogs are rambunctious and require attention.  They need room to run.  Small dogs tend to be more hyper than larger dogs.  These are things that you should consider when wanting to adopt a small dog.  Other things to consider when wanting to adopt a small dog are time, money, and love.  Whenever you adopt a dog large or small you should make sure that you have time to take care of it.  You also need to make sure that you have the money to deal with any medical issues and mandatory maintenance of the dog.  Then of course there is love all animals need love to survive and grow.

Check with your landlord to see if there are any pet policies, and maybe talk to someone you know that has a small dog or has adopted a small dog.  Make sure that the decision you make is the right one for you and your situation."

            "For Americans looking to adopt internationally, Russia has long been had a stable adoption program. Russia has typically been the third most popular sending country for international adoptions in the United States. Russian children who are given up for adoption typically are so because the poverty level in the country is such that raising a child would be difficult or impossible for the lower class parents. The result is that a large number of Russian children are made available for foreign adoption.",
            "Recently, however, attempts at reform within the Russian adoption system have led to major delays in the adoption process. A recently passed Russian law requires adoption agencies to be re-accredited. The process of applying for and being granting accreditation and licensing has proven to be a slow one, resulting in the delays that are currently being seen.",
            "Applications for accreditation must be reviewed by five Russian government ministries: Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of these ministries sometimes requires clarification or additional information on certain applications, which leads to further delay. The website for the United States Embassy in Moscow cites one example in which the Ministry of Justice recently returned several applications to the agencies, asking for further information1. The Ministry of Education can only sign off on the accreditation after receiving approval from each of the four other ministries. At the time of this writing (May 30, 2007) the Ministry of Education had not announced a date by which the review will be complete, and no adoption agencies had yet been accredited by the ministry.",
            "These postponements in the adoption process have had some other consequences, as well. For example, prospective adoptive parents are having trouble traveling to Russia for their adoption visits. Russian adoptions require two such visits, the first being about a week and the second lasting two to three weeks. The Russian government issues visas to adopting parents for these visits, with specific parameters indicating the dates of the visit. However, because all adoptions are falling behind schedule, Americans are attempting to travel to Russia outside the dates specified on their visas. This can be especially problematic if they are able to travel to Russia, but wind up staying beyond the departure date of the visa. Significant delays in departing Russia can occur.",
            "For the moment, adoptions in Russia are still mired in the bureaucratic accreditation process. The Russian government and the Ministry of Education are unable to say when the review might be over and adoptions will be back up to speed. For those wishing to adopt a Russian child, it is still possible to do so, but one should be prepared to weather a significant waiting period. If enduring the process is not feasible, there are plenty of other countries with available children to consider. Some other viable options include China, South Korea, Guatemala, and many countries in Africa. News and updates on the Russian adoption process are available from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow website:",

Hoping that the color difference would not match up to the love and belonging the child would feel with its new family.  There are fewer young white children available for adoption, leaving adoptive parents feeling the need to reach out and help any child in need, regardless of race.  There are different opinions on Tran racial adoption, one is that a child should be put in a home with at least one parent of the same race. Others believe that race should not be considered at all.",
            "To prepare for adoption it is important for everyone,  but even more important if you're contemplating Tran racial adoption to consider a few things.  When thinking of Tran racial adoption one should think about your personnel beliefs and you attitude toward race and ethnicity.  When you adopt a child who is considered different, the entire family will be different.  One needs to remember that to some, different is strange and sometimes scary.  Not everyone will understand your decision to adopt Tran racially.  Here are a few more things to ask yourself, where you live, is it integrated?  Are the schools in your area integrated?  Do you have friends that are different races and ethnicity?",
            "To Tran racially adopt you need to become seriously involved in parenting, you can not allow racially or ethnically prejudice remarks in your home.  You will need to encompass your family with support.  You should celebrate all cultures and do not be afraid to discuss race and culture.  Most importantly you should be there for your child and let them know that no matter what someone says to them and no matter how bad it hurts them that you are there for them and that you love them.  Parents of Tran racial adoption should encourage themselves and allow themselves to believe strongly that their family belongs together.  You should make it very clear that it is not ok to make fun of people who are different.  Teach your child to stand up to prejudice without starting fights.  They should learn to use their words not their fists.",
            "Many agencies are not open about Tran racial adoption policies, because it is such a touchy subject.  You should ask your agency about how they feel about it.  Tran racial adoption was the subject of a bill before congress in 1994, and after an intense debate they found that they agreed on one thing, that all adults of all backgrounds need to help adopted children of all backgrounds reach their potential.",
            "Tran racial adoption began after World War II, when there was a large number of children without a home or family.  American adoptive couples were not always childless, but simply family oriented.  Parents who adopt Tran racially can not ignore the fact that they become a minority family.  They will be subjected to questions, odd looks, and prejudice remarks.  Research shows that children raised in a Tran racial environment tend to handle the cultural gap extremely well, and that parents who adopt Tran racially have to work harder than same race parents, this way they can empower their children and teach them about different cultures and backgrounds.",
            "All in all, Tran racial adoption could be a wonderful experience for the right family.  You might have to work a little harder, but from what I have found it is all worth the effort."

This doesn\u2019t mean that the child needs to see them or that you have to write to them. This could mean that you send pictures or that they send you things.

Normally spywares record the various types of web sites you visit which are later used by web advertisers to allow them to send you unwanted emails and pop-ups.",
            "This is why spyware are usually frowned upon and greatly avoided. They are more intrusive than adware. Spyware have their own separate executable programs which allow them to record your keystrokes, scan files on your hard disks and look at other applications that you use including but not limited to chat programs, cookies and Web browser settings.",

Similar to spyware, adwares are advertising materials which are packaged into a software or program and are installed automatically once that particular program or software is added into the computer system. Some forms of adware, on the other hand, download advertising contents as a particular application is being utilized. It is quite unfortunate that most of the adware programs take the form of spywares that is they track and report user information to program authors.",
            "Some signs of spyware infections include pop-up ads that seem to be not related to the site you are viewing. More often than not, spyware pop-ups are advertisements about adult contents. Also if you notice your computer slowing down, there's a big chance that spywares and its other components have found their way in your operating system. When the Windows desktop also takes a longer time to load, its best to scan your computer for possible spyware infections.",
            "Meanwhile, viruses are destructive form of software. They were purely designed and created for one purpose alone: to wreck havoc to your computer. They destroy whatever they come in contact to and will initiate self replication and infect as many components of the computer's operating system or network as possible.",
            "Nowadays, a lot of anti-virus software also provides spyware and adware scanning and removal utilities. Some programs, however, are focused on located and deleting or destroying spyware and adware programs. Whether is an anti-virus software or a anti-spyware dedicated scanner, they both search your computer and identify any spyware and virus installed on your system.",
            "They then remove it as well as their components located in the system registry among other places in your computer. It is therefore, good to regularly update your virus or spyware scanner to ensure that your computer is protected from the thousands of spyware and viruses in the internet. Never be fooled from ads that claim that their products only contain adware.",
            "These adware maybe spyware in disguised and are just waiting to be deployed for them to gather your information. Learn to setup firewall systems and always block pop-up blockers to minimize computer infection and ensure the security of all your computer files."

But for those who are intrigued by the term, it is now high time that you brace yourself with the truth behind its name.  Adware stands for advertising-supported software. What is this all about then? Adware is in truth any kind of software package that displays, play, or downloads automatically all sorts of advertising materials into the computer either after the installation of such software or during such time when the application is currently being run or used.",
            "How can this be? You might be wondering. Basing on its application procedures, the adware is some kind of software that is either bundled together with another program or is integrated into a particular software. Adware is often used by a programmer because it is a means of recovering the overall programming development costs. Most of the times too, adware permits the use of the program with either no charge at all or at a relatively low price. Thus, the use of the adware continuously motivates the programmer to maintain, write, and upgrade such kind of software product. Some of the existing adwares are likewise sharewares. How does each of them differ in characteristics and use? Adware is primarily oriented to be advertising supported. The users of the software are also offered choices of whether or not to pay for the licensed or registered copies so as to do away with all those popping up advertisements.",
            "Apart from all these, the existence of the adware is held up in controversy. Why so? It is because the adware is a software which is a disguised as a type of spyware. The adware vehemently tracks, reports, and usually resells the particular information about a user and his activities without his slightest knowing. Oftentimes, adware is also a malware. Meaning, it is able to interrupt with the rest of the computer software applications in use so as to force the computer users to visit the advertised website. Adware, spyware, and malware are the terms which may be misconstrued for one another. The shortest explanation to this confusion is when the user gets to install adware on one particular computer and then is geared towards activating it for a tracking tool; then, the adware now becomes a spyware. Meaning, when another user comes to use that certain computer, his activities get tracked by the adware without him knowing it.",
            "Adware removal is done by employing certain programs that will detect, then quarantine, and totally remove the adware as well as its being a spyware. Some of the best adware removal applications include Lavasoft\u2019s Adware, BulletProofSoft\u2019s BPS Spyware Adware, Sunbelt Software\u2019s CounterSpy, Patrick Kolla\u2019s Spybot Search and Destroy, Intermute\u2019s SpySubtract, Webroot\u2019s SpySweeper, and PCTool\u2019s Spyware Doctor.

            "Spyware and adware removal nowadays is just a matter of choosing a well equipped anti-spyware program or utility. You install the software into your system and will scan and delete or quarantine spyware and adware programs that were secretly installed in your computer.",
            "The proliferation of spyware and adware programs in the internet has lead an established and highly developed anti-spyware industry. As long as disgruntled internet users abound, the anti-spyware companies will continue to create utilities that will combat the onslaught of spyware and adware on your computers.",
            "Basically a spyware program infects the computer through whatever files a user downloads from the internet. Adware and spyware attaches themselves on these files and can rapidly spread throughout the computer's operating system. The sypware will commonly records information like IP addresses, credit card numbers, lists websites you visit and so on.",
            "But as the spyware infects and spreads your computer, it installs components which affect the overall performance of the computer. They can also cause a degradation of the system resulting to unwanted CPU activity, inappropriate disk usage, and problems with network traffic. All these will cause your computer to low down. It will eventually become unstable and will cause software crashes and will sometimes prevent you from connecting to your networks and to the internet.",
            "Some spyware programs are quite obvious but others are more covert, operating undetected by the user. When problems occur in the computer's operating system, because these spywares are undetectable by ordinary means, users tend to believe that the problems were brought about by problems in the hardware or by a computer virus. But all the while, a spyware program is the one causing the ruckus.",
            "More often not, a computer will be infected with more than one spyware program and have various components installed. Recent studies indicate that when one finds a spyware program installed in his computer, chances are dozens of the components of that spyware is installed all over the computer's system.",
            "And as the number of spyware programs and its components increase, users will encounter problems like computer slowing its functions to a crawl. Other spyware programs are more notorious. Some spyware will disable the computer's firewall system or anti-virus software thus making the computer more vulnerable to spyware, adware and other infectious attacks.",
            "Microsoft Windows platform users are more susceptible from these spyware and adware attacks. Probably because of the popularity of Windows which makes them an attractive and profitable target for spyware agents. Likewise, because of the tight knit Internet Explorer and Windows enjoy, IE users will most likely get an infection from spyware and adware than users of other internet browsers like FireFox.",
            "Meanwhile other computer users are changing to Linux or Apple Macintosh platforms which appear to be less attractive to spyware and adware agents. These two platforms works on Unix underpinnings which restricts access to the operating system unlike with Windows.",
            "It is quite unfortunate and rather irritating that spyware and adware programs grew and developed in the World Wide Web. But we cannot do anything about it now. What we can do is protect ourselves from their attacks by being cautious and by conducting regular spyware scanning and removals as well as performing regular updating of anti-virus and anti-spyware software to ensure that our computers are free from the annoying and damaging spyware."

When installing a new program into your computer, you are asked to tick off an option of whether you agree or disagree with the programs end user license agreement (EULA). Do yourself a favor and read what is written in the agreement before agreeing to proceed in the installation. Many shareware and freeware programs come bundled with spyware and adware programs and in some cases you can learn about them by reading the agreement carefully.",

            "Consequently, if an existing program infected with spyware is in your system, your anti spyware system will attempt to remove the infection. Since most spyware are closely bundled into certain programs, the removal of the spyware may cause the legitimate program it comes with to stop functioning as well."

            "The term spyware software always creates a nasty image. When computer users hear of this word, they would always get the fearful sensations tickling their nerves. Why not? Spyware softwares are after revealed to be on the negative side! Someone who installs a spyware software into any unit of computer is branded to be a hacker. True indeed. Spyware software applications are used for hacking, tracking, detecting, stealing of identification details, credit account numbers, passwords, and many other heinous deeds.",
            "But let us also give the spyware software some benefit of the doubt. There are actually some states in America that tolerate the use of spyware software programs because the administrators believe that there is goodness in its usage. For one, the spyware softwares are used always for spouse monitoring, child monitoring, and the detection of the activities of the employees of big firms. Child monitoring through the use of spyware software programs aim at detecting the websites which the child often visits and the people that he or she often chats with. Spouse monitoring is geared towards tracking the chat conversations done by either of the couple. In the business industry, it is a must that the big bosses of the company are aware of the productivity rate of their employees. So they rather prefer to monitor the computer activities of their subordinates. Through the spyware software, the employees refuse to go idle. But then some states in America condemn the sale of spyware software and they even hold it up as one serious crime.",
            "Generally, the spyware software comes in various names such as keylogger, PC monitoring, PC surveillance, and many others. But whatever the name used is, there is only one aim that surfaces when we talk of spyware software\u2014the recording of the computer user\u2019s activities. This includes the recording of the passwords, visited websites, chat conversations, and every little act done in the computer. It is like having a movie director who watches the acting of the computer user. The spy then gets to read with you as you browse through your mails and as you open any account of yours. It is like sharing your personal details with another party. Talk about hackers! The only thing about the spyware software is that it does not have to go through several procedures of opening or using your account since every little key that you type in is recorded.",
            "Because of the bad image that gets stuck in the reputation of the spyware software, most people are having negative impressions of it. It is then upon the user of the spyware software to use it for the good. But then if the goal would be to pose destruction on other people, it will not be a really good idea to avail of a spyware software. But then if you think you are on the right side, you can get a free spyware software from the leading sources that reside in the internet portals. Several manufacturers and providers of the free spyware software programs are fraud. They only lure you into the heinous deed. Hence, you should exude extra care when dealing with free spyware software programs. But of course you will not experience severe difficulty with finding free spyware software applications as they can be all over the net. The real thing is\u2014you simply have to be on the good side."

            "The term \"malware\" is an amalgamation of the words \"malicious\" and \"software\". When it comes down to it, the term \"malware\" actually gets its definition from the intent of the creator and not from the function of the software itself. This is because a piece of software cannot be termed \"malicious\" unless it is used for malicious purposes. As we all know, the purpose of a tool such as software depends on the creator.",
            "Here are some types of malware that you should be aware of:",
            "1) Infectious \u2013 This type of malware is composed mainly of computer viruses and worms. These are the most commonly known types of malware. In fact, the word \"virus\" today is more often used today to indicate a computer virus than an actual physiological virus. Viruses differ from worms in their operation and distribution.",
            "A \"virus\" used to be spread via the use of floppy disks. A virus would copy itself into an executable file and would be run whenever a certain program is activated or a certain disk is opened.",
            "The concept of a computer worm was introduced when the internet was first used to infect systems with malware. This type of malware would scan different networks for any vulnerable systems and then copy itself to those systems. From its new base, the worm would then begin a new process of scanning and copying.",
            "Although these two terms used to have very distinct meanings and uses, they are now actually used interchangeably to indicate any type of infectious malware.",

            "a) Trojan Horses \u2013 serving the same purpose as its mythical counterpart, today's Trojan horse may have different appearances. Some Trojan horses take the form of utilities. His appearance encourages a person to make use of them and make improvements on their system. When the unwitting user downloads the program, this then opens a door for other types of software and malware to be introduced into an end-user's system.",
            "Trojan horses are often used by creators of viruses in order to cause a massive computer virus outbreak. By introducing a virus into one network via a Trojan horse, the creator ensures the spread of that virus to other networks.",
            "b) Backdoors \u2013 this type of malware creates an alternative pathway or route inside your system. It is used by hackers to create an alternative pathway into a computer. This helps them avoid any sort of security systems that people nowadays place inside their computers. Once inside a system, the hackers will then be able to do anything they want.",
            "3) Profit malware \u2013 some forms of malware are created by companies who wish to increase their profits. This type of malware often comes in the form of a dialer. A dialer is a type of malware which messes with your internet connection. Dialers reroute your net connection through an expensive phone line thus, increasing the bills that you have to pay. An unwitting person who has his or her system infected with this type of spyware is forced to pay a huge amount of cash for a service that he or she definitely does not need. Being infected with this type of malware is just like flushing your wallet down the toilet."

            "\"Fight fire with fire\" is an advice often handed out today to help people with various problems. In fact, this advice is being taken very seriously by people in the software industry. Many people today are becoming aware of the problems posed by malicious software. In fact, 80 percent of computer users today have their systems infected with spyware. Of these people, only about 5 percent know that they have spyware installed into their computers. These are very troubling figures indeed. This is the reason why people today look for solutions against spyware in anti-spyware tools.",
            "Anti-spyware stops spyware from doing damage to your computer using two methods: prevention and solution.",
            "1) Prevention \u2013 Anti-spyware stops spyware from ever being installed inside your system. This is done through different ways. Some anti-spyware tools scan every type of information that passes into your computer. The anti-spyware software then checks it against a database of known spyware. Because of this, if a known spyware tries to npenetrate your system, it is immediately prevented from doing so. Of course, this is only effective as long as the spyware database is kept updated.",
            "Another method used by antispyware to prevent spyware from being installed into your system is to limit the activities of cetain programs known to be used in distributing spyware. One such program is ActiveX. By doing this, anti-spyware tools will lessen the chance that any spyware will be installed in your system.",
            "2) Solution \u2013 on the off-chance that any type of spyware already exists in your system, anti-spyware tools are also able to get rid of those. This is done by regular scanning of your system. Anti-spyware deletes spyware and makes sure that no traces remain of it to damage your computer.",
            "Usually, programmers find this type of method easier to incorporate into anti-spyware software than preventive measures. This is because of the fact that most methods used by people to introduce spyware into a system cannot be stopped without affecting the common operations of a computer. For example, some spyware creators make use of the program Flash to introduce spyware into a computer. However, some legitimate sites do use Flash to make your web surfing more entertaining. This means that disabling Flash entirely would not be feasible for many users. Hence, anti-spyware manufacturers are faced with the dilemma of setting parameters for such programs that would prevent spyware but ensure the satisfaction of the customers.",
            "Of course, there are alternatives to using anti-spyware against spyware. But these solutions may prove to be impractical. One method is to just limit your computer\u2019s contact with other networks. This means that you should limit your internet use.",
            "Of course, this solution would seem horrendous to some people because of the fact that most people today depend on the internet for their needs.",
            "Another solution is to try and remove any spyware yourself. However, this may take some time and could cause some serious damage to your system if you have no idea what you are doing. Because of this, it is not really recommended that you tinker with spyware on your own.",
            "As you can see, using anti-spyware against spyware is still the best thing you can do to solve your spyware problems. By using specialized software, you can fight fire with fire and rid your system of all those problems."

Unless you bring a chance of clothes with you and place them in your carryon bag, you are out of luck. That is why it is important that you think of what you will be wearing before you leave for the airport.

In addition to being comfortable, you will find, in most cases, that these types of clothes are the best for airport security, especially when entering airport screening checkpoints.

Essentially, this means that you should be able to enter the security checkpoint and leave it quicker than most other travelers, such as the travelers who are decked out in accessories.",
            "When it comes to clothing accessories, you will find that a number of different items set off airport metal detectors. That is why most airport security officers request that you remove all of your jewelry.  Once your jewelry is removed, you will need to place it in a small bin, which will be scanned right along with your carryon luggage.  Whether you have rings or a necklace, you are advised to remove them, if you can.  For your convenience, you can leave your earrings on.

Even if you do not have a disability, you also need to be prepared if you are traveling with someone else who has one.  This preparation does not just include packing your bags for your trip, but it is also includes familiarizing yourself with air travel rules.

            "The first step in preparing for a trip with someone who is disabled, whether that person be yourself or another traveler, is to alert the airline.  When making your reservation, you may want to inform the airline staff of any disability or medical condition that you may have. Although this is not necessary, it may be a good idea, especially if you will be traveling with medical equipment.  Extra accommodations will need to be made for those who are traveling, past airport security checkpoints, with wheelchairs or mobility scooters.  Learning what you will need to do with these items, ahead of time, is a great way to make your travel plans run as smoothly as possible.",

If you or someone who you know is traveling with medical equipment that will set off the alarms, it is likely that they will be pulled aside for additional screening. This screening should only take a few minutes, but it will be done by a trained professional who will show compassion when dealing with those with a disability.",
            "Unlike most other air travelers, who at this time are required to remove their shoes, those with a disability can leave their shoes on if they choose to do so.  However, it is important to note that you may be subject to additional screening.  To prevent this additional screening from occurring, you are advised to remove your shoes, if at all possible. In the event that you are unable to, it will not be a big ordeal. In fact, the additional screening often requires a quick swipe of a metal detector wand.",
            "In addition to those with a disability, most airports have made special arrangements and exceptions for those who have a medical condition, especially one that requires medication at a specific time.  You are allowed to keep your medication with you, in your carryon luggage, but you are advised to keep the dosages in small amounts.  Due to the current ban on liquids, you are advised to have the proper medical identification. This means that you should keep your medication in the original package, especially if your name is on it.  To be allowed through to the next checkpoint, your name will have to match the name of the prescription bottle. If it does not, there is a chance that you will have your medication confiscated.",
            "By keeping the above mentioned points in mind you or your traveling partners, who may have a medical condition or a disability, should easily be able to make it to your intended destination. In the event that you are unsure about a particular screening procedure or if you have any other questions, you are advised to contact the airline in which you will be flying on or the airport that you will be leaving from, before your arrive there.

However, when it comes to air travel rules and children, many parents are confused. Many of those parents mistakenly believe that their child is exempt from all air travel rules, including airport security checkpoints. Unfortunately, this is not true.",

Although you will all be going through the same screening process, you will want to prepare for it a little bit differently. This preparation should not only be used to ensure that you and your family make it through the airport screening process, but that you and your family have a pleasant experience when doing so.",
            "The first step in preparing for air travel is explaining the air travel rules to your child or children. Depending on their age, this can be a fairly difficult task.

Although there is a good chance that the alarm will not sound, especially if you check their clothing before you leave; it could still be a fairly scary process.  In the event that the alarm on the metal detector does sound, your child will be pulled aside, just like everyone else.",

For instance, there is a good chance that your child would like to take a drink with them. Recently, there was a ban imposed on liquids and carryon luggage.  While there are a few exceptions, namely baby formula, your child will likely have to go without a beverage, although they should be provided with one as soon as they board the plane.  It is also advised to let them know that some of their toys may need to be left at home. These toys may include ones that are large, have sharp objects, or appear as if they are real weapons.",
            "As previously mentioned, your child\u2019s age is important when explaining air travel to them. You will find that most older children, including teenagers, completely understand everything that you are saving, but smaller children may not.  If you are afraid that your toddler does not comprehend what you are saying, it may be a good idea to arrive at the airport even earlier than recommended.  You should be able to stay off to the side and watch other passengers, especially those who are going through the screening process. This, along with a simple explanation, may help your child to see and understand what will happen to them later on.",
            "While you may not necessarily think about it, it is important that you make sure that your child understands that they are not to joke about having a bomb or any other weapon on an airplane.  Airport security, although it is a serious issue, has become a joke to many people, including some children. Your child may not have a weapon onboard and they may only make a comment with the intention of getting a laugh, there is a lot more that they could get. As previously mentioned, when it comes to air travel children receive the same attention as adults do. This means that if your child is overheard making a joke on the plane that may cause some security concerns; it is likely that your whole family, including your child, will be removed from the plane and detained by airport security, until the situation has been resolved.",

Even if you feel that your child is mature for their age, it is still a good idea to remind them of all air travel rules, not only for the sake of your trip, but for their own safety as well.",

Some individuals need to make a business trip, others are visiting friends or family, others are going on vacation, and some are making a cross country move.  If you are moving, there is a good chance that you may need to bring your pet along with you. If this is the case, you will find that you are subject to a whole new set of air travel rules.  Before leaving for the airport, with your pet or pets in tow, you are advised to famialrize yourself with those rules.",

Certain pets are allowed to be on airplanes, but that does not mean that all airlines will allow it.  If you are planning on traveling with your pet, you will need to inform your airline of this information upfront.  This is vital because not all airlines will allow you to bring a pet onboard. Therefore, if you do not check with your airline before heading to the airport, you may be unable to board your flight.",

If you will be keeping your animal in the cabin with you, as opposed to having your animal treated as checked baggage, you will need to make sure that your pet carrier will not negatively affect other passengers. Your pet carrier must not block aisle ways or encroach on other passenger\u2019s seating spaces.  In addition to these general rules and restrictions, you may find that each airline has their own set of pet carrier rules.",
            "Almost all airlines require that your pets have the proper documents before being allowed on their airplanes.  These documents most commonly include information on your pet\u2019s health.  Most airlines require that your pet undergoes a medical evaluation before being transported by airplane.  This information is not only used to ensure that your pet is healthy enough to fly, but is also used to ensure that they are protected with the proper vaccinations.  Proper vaccinations will not only protect your pet, but other passengers, as well as airline staff.",

This examination most commonly includes being sent though the x-ray machine with your carryon luggage; however, it is important to note that your pet will not have to go through the x-ray machine; the metal detector should be enough.",

If you are able to store the items in your carryon luggage, you are advised to do so. It is no secret that checked baggage gets tossed around in a number of different fashions.  With expensive electronic equipment, your equipment is less likely to suffer damage if you are the one in charge of caring for it.  In addition to a reduction in damage, most airlines are restricting the use of baggage locks.

If you are planning on traveling with your golf clubs, you will need to treat them as checked baggage. All airlines currently have a ban on golf clubs being used as carryon luggage.

If you are planning on enjoying a game of baseball, on your next vacation or business trip, you will want to store your baseball bats in a secure bag that can safely be transported through different airports.  While baseball bats are banned from airplane cabins, there is no mention of other equipment, such as cleats, helmets, or baseballs.  For your own convenience, you may want to store these other baseball supplies in the same place as your baseball bats, in your checked baggage.",

All bows, arrows, and guns are strictly prohibited from being in airplane cabins. In fact, if you try and pass through a security checkpoint with these items, is there is a good chance that you will be detained by airport security, for further questioning. Although you may not necessarily think about it, bows, arrows, and guns are not only used for recreational purposes, but they are also used to harm others.",
            "Additional sporting goods that are banned from being included in your carryon luggage include pool cues, ski poles, lacrosse sticks, or hockey sticks.  As with all other items, if you are concerned with the safety of your sporting equipment, you are advised to rethink your decision to bring that equipment along.  You can help to protect your equipment by making sure that everything is properly and safely packaged; however, there are no guarantees.  You are also advised against relying on compensation from the airlines if and when your sports equipment suffers damage.",
            "As previously mentioned, there are some sporting goods that are outright banned, but other rules are not so clear.  If you are trying to decide whether or not you can pack other equipment in your carryon luggage, such as masks or other protective gear, you are advised to ask before heading out to the airport. In the event that these items are banned, you may have to make additional arrangements. Regardless of whether you choose to return the items to your car or mail them to your home, you may end up wasting unnecessary time and money.",

Essentially, this means that you cannot store these items in your carryon luggage; however, they can be packed in your checked baggage.

Not doing so may result in an air airline employee receiving an injury that could have been prevented.",

These tools include axes, hatchets, cattle prods, hammers, and crowbars.  This ban is mostly imposed due to the size and weight of these items.  As with most other tools, the airline industry will allow you to store these heavy tools in your checked baggage.",

Even though these items are allowed, you may raise suspicion from having them with you aboard a plane. That suspicion may not necessity come from airport security officials, but it may come from other passengers.  With the way that the world works today, it may be best if you refrain from including these tools in your carryon luggage, unless you absolutely need them.",

In fact, with today\u2019s airport security screening, it is virtually impossible for you to get away with storing prohibited or illegal items inside your checked baggage.

A quick check of your luggage may include rummaging through all of your belongings, looking for anything out of the ordinary.

After your bags have been properly screened, some airlines will allow you to replace the locks on your checked baggage, but not all will.

The first checkpoint is when you go to register for your seat on the plane. This is the time when you will be presented with your boarding passes and when you must hand over the luggage that you would like checked.  In addition to handing over your plane tickets or requesting your boarding passes, you will need to show the proper forms of identification.

This point is where you will be required to have your carryon luggage scanned by an x-ray machine. You will also need to walk through a metal detector.

At the current time, all air travelers, with the exception of those with a disability or hindering medical condition, are required to remove their shoes.

            "In recent years, the media has been flooded with examples of security breaches on airplanes and in airports.  Although a number of these instances have turned out legitimate, there are others that were simply a mistake. Although you might assume this mistake was made on the part of airport security, most times it wasn\u2019t.  In many instances, the mistake was made by a traveler; likely a traveler who was unaware of the consequences for not properly following air travel rules.  Don\u2019t let yourself be one of those travelers.",

There are a few exceptions, but one of those exceptions does not include drinks for adults. No matter how much you want to have a bottled water with you, it is just not possible. Instead of fighting it, you are advised to live with it because if you don\u2019t, you could suffer the consequences.",

Honestly, those consequences all depend on which airport you are at, the airline which you are traveling with, the rule that you are violating, and your attitude during the ordeal.  The most common consequence is that you will be delayed a short period of time. For instance, if you are trying to bring a soft drink onboard or a cigarette lighter, you may be taken aside for just a moment. That moment will be just long enough for you to hand over the prohibited item and be reminded of the importance of following air travel rules.",
            "While many air travelers can get away with a simple warning, there are others who suffer more serious consequences. One of those consequences is being banned from your flight.

        "content": [
            "Each day, millions of travelers hop on an airplane to get their next destination. Whether you are planning a visit to friends or family, attending a business meeting, or just taking a family vacation, it is likely that you will not be traveling alone. Almost all air travelers bring some sort of luggage with them.  Unfortunately, when it comes to packing their bags, many travelers have no idea what they should or shouldn\u2019t bring along.",
            "If you are gearing up for your next trip, you are advised to carefully choose the items that you are planning on brining along with you. This includes items that will be packed in your checked baggage, in addition to your carryon luggage.  Not only should be thinking about convenience, but you should also be thinking about air travel rules, namely the rules that specify which items or materials are allowed aboard an airplane and which ones are not.",
            "When examining items prohibited during air travel, it is important to remember that some items may only have a partial ban. An example of a partial ban is a ban that may prevent certain items from being stored in your carryon luggage, but not in your checked baggage.  Most of these bans, such as liquids, large tools, sporting goods, and sharp objects, are imposed only for safety reasons.",
            "Although a large number of items are allowed to be in your checked baggage, despite being banned from your carryon luggage, there are some items that you cannot, under any circumstances, bring aboard an airplane. These items most commonly fall under the category of explosive or flammable materials.  You will find that you are prohibited from brining bombs, dynamite, gun powder, lighters, flares, or strike anywhere matches on an airplane.  In fact, trying to board an airplane with these items in your possession, whether they be in you carryon luggage or not, could land you in serious trouble.",
            "In addition to items that are banned by the airline industry, you will also want to think about convenience, when packing your bags for your next business trip or vacation.  When it comes to carryon luggage, you will find that some airlines restrict the size of your bags, as well as the weight. For your own convenience, you will want to keep your carryon luggage as light as possible. The same should be said for your checked baggage.  Although you may not be carrying it with you at all times, it is still advised that you pack as light as possible. A number of airlines have strict weight limits on carryon luggage.  If your luggage weights more than what is allowed, you may be charged an extra fee or you may even be required to remove some of your belongings.",
            "It is also advised that you think of the items that you are brining along with you, specifically their monetary and semimetal value. When traveling aboard an airplane, there are a number of instances where you belongings may suffer damage, especially those stored in checked baggage. If you would take a large financial or emotional hit from the loss or destruction of your personal belongings, you are advised to leave those items at home. Although you may not be able to have your laptop with you or your favorite piece of jewelry, it is nice to know that your treasured items are safe at home.",
            "It may seem like a difficult task to leave some of your belongings at home, but you are encouraged to do so, whenever possible.  By keeping all of the above mentioned points into consideration, you are sure to not only avoid trouble at the airport, but have less to worry about as well.",

Although you shouldn\u2019t, it isn\u2019t recommended for your heath and not to mention its illegal, there are a large number of individuals who do. When it comes to drug use, whether it be marijuana, cocaine, or some illegally obtained prescription pills, there are many individuals who are addicted. Aside from being addicted, some individuals just like to take them, even though they probably could stop at any time.  If you are one of those individuals, there will likely come a point in time when you will need to travel, maybe even on airplane. If so, you are advised to proceed with caution.",
            "In the recent years, airport security has drastically changed. Before September 11th, some airports only randomly screened baggage, but now they are always checked. Not only is baggage being checked for dangerous weapons, but it is also checked for illegal items, such as drugs. This means that the next time you plan on flying with a stash, you are advised against doing so. No matter how smart you are, there is a very good chance that you will get caught. Despite this chance, there are still many travelers who try.",
            "The number one mistake that most individuals, make when flying with illegal drugs, is carry the drugs with them.  New airport rules have been established. Those rules require that all passengers need to take off their shoes.  Shoes will now be scanned with all other carryon bags. This means that if you plan on hiding something illegal in your shoes, whether it be drugs or not, you will be caught.  It is also advised that you do not carry anything illegal in your carryon bags.  In addition to being scanned though an x-ray machine, they may also be examined by airport security.",
            "Since it is too risky to carry illegal items with them, many travelers make the decision to hide them in their checked baggage. While it may have been possible to successfully do this ten years ago, it is not anymore. Now, almost every airline searches through checked baggage.  If your bags are locked, there is a good chance that you will be asked to remove those locks. When it comes to checking checked baggage, there are two main types of searches that are done.  All bags will be thoroughly searched for anything out of the ordinary, but more intense searches are conducted randomly.",
            "Do you know what the difference is between a traditional search and an intensive search? Instead of just shifting your items around, airport security will actually look through your entire bag. This may mean having every single one of your luggage compartments checked, the pockets of your clothing checked, as well all bags, including makeup bags.  In the event that you are randomly selected for one of these checks, there is virtually no way that you will make it to the next point, your airplane seat.",
            "One of the many reasons why a traveler brings banned items, not to mention illegal items, on a flight is because they think that nothing would happen to them.  Now, if you are caught trying to bring a banned item onboard, such as a cigarette lighter, you may just have your item confiscated.  Additional actions may be taken, but for the most part, you will just receive a warning. However, there is a difference between just a banned item and a banned item, which is also illegal. That difference may mean more than having to miss your flight. In fact, it could mean jail time.",
            "In addition to illegal drugs, alcohol, which is considered legal if not consumed at the correct age, is prohibited on some airplanes. Most airlines have restrictions on alcohol, including checked baggage. In most cases, alcohol cannot be brought on the plane if it is more than 140 proof. When it doubt, it is best to verify the rules and restrictions with the airline you plan on flying with.",

Even if you have, there is there is a good chance that things have changed since the last time that you were at the airport. While you may be thinking about the airport layout, it is actually the air travel rules that have likely changed. As more security issues arise, often on a daily or weekly basis, the airlines decide to enforce new travel rules.  In the event that these new enforcements do go into effect, do you know how to go about finding what they are?",
            "Before you can learn to famialrize yourself with new air travel rules, if there are any, you will want to understand the benefits of learning those rules. Unfortunately, too many travelers are worried about having the proper forms of identification that they don\u2019t always worry about the items that they pack.  If you are one of those individuals, there is a good chance that you may, unintentionally, pack items that are prohibited past airport security checkpoints.  Depending on the prohibited item, you may be required to make additional accommodations, discard of the item, or turn it over to airport security.",
            "In addition to prohibited items, there are also new air travel rules that apply to security screening procedures. For instance, all air travelers are now required to remove their shoes. Your shoes will be scanned along with the rest of your carryon luggage. While this may pose an inconvenience, it is a requirement.  Failing to comply with this requirement, as well as others, may lead to you being detained by airport security or local authorities.  In addition to missing your flight, you may even face prosecution for your actions.  However, this can all be prevented by knowing and understanding the new air travel rules, as well as the old ones.",
            "Perhaps, the best way to famialrize yourself with air travel rules is to go directly to the source. That source is the organization that makes and essentially enforces those rules, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). You can obtain valuable information from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), including information on air travel rules, by directly contacting them or by visiting their online website. That online website can be found at www.tsa.gov.  You are advised to fully examine this online website. You will find that it has a large amount of information that you need to know.",

By searching with the words new air travel rules, you should be provided with a number of different results. Those results are likely to include websites or news reports with information on air travel, including the rules that are enforced aboard all airplanes or in all airports.  When doing this, it is important to keep your source of information in mind.  A large number of websites with inaccurate, misleading, outdated information can be found online.",
            "It may also be a good idea to contact the airline or airport that you plan on using. This contact can be made over the phone or the same information can easily be obtained online. Whether you visit the online website of a particular airline or airport or contact their representatives directly, you should be able to famialrize yourself with newly implemented air travel rules.  It is also advised that you contact each airline or airport directly because they tend to have different rules. Airport screening procedures may vary from one airport to another, as well as rules aboard particular airlines.",

For instance, all liquids are currently banned from being stored in your carryon luggage, but small amounts of baby formula, eye care drops, and prescribed medications are allowed.  In addition to information on items that are prohibited aboard an airplane or only allowed in certain plane areas, you can also learn more about the airport security screening process.

            "When it comes to not following air travel rules or cooperating with airport security, you will find that there are a number of different consequences.  Perhaps, the most common consequence is that you will miss your flight.  If you are tied up with airport security, they are not required to hold your flight just for you; therefore you may be required to book a reservation on another flight.  In addition to missing your flight, there is a chance that you could be detained by airport security or local authorities.",
            "While it is possible to be detained by airport security or by local authorities, you will find that it is often a rare occurrence.  Most airport security incidents can be cleared up in a matter of minutes; however, there is still the chance that law enforcement could intervene.  When it comes to banned items aboard a plan, you will not necessarily be detained unless you try to sneak aboard an item that is dangerous or illegal, such as drugs, guns, bombs, or other weapons. In the event you just forgot to take your mascara out of your purse, you will likely just have it taken away from you.",
            "As previously mentioned, another air travel rule, aside from leaving prohibited items at home, involves airport security checkpoints. All passengers are required to go through the proper checkpoints and successfully pass through them, before being able to board an airplane.  Not only will you be required to hand over your carryon luggage bags, to be properly screened, but you will also be required to walk through a metal detector, as well as take off your shoes. All passengers, including children, need to follow these procedures. In the event that you refuse to, you will not be permitted to board your flight.  There is also a good chance that you will be detained by airport security or by local authorities.",

Since most individuals, including men, women, and children, fly with some sort of liquid, there is a good chance that you will need to alter your packing habits.  When examining the liquid ban, it is important to remember one thing.  Liquids are banned from being brought with you onto the airplane in your carry on luggage. This ban does not prohibit you from brining these items with you; it just means that you have to place them in your checked baggage.",
            "When trying to determine which liquid items are prohibited from being stored in your carryon luggage, it is best to examine these items in different categories. This is because this new ban means that a large number of items are now only allowed in bags that will be checked upon arrival at the airport. In fact, there are too many items for you to individually learn about.",
            "Some of the most popular items that are now included in the liquid air travel ban include health and beauty products, especially those that are liquid or gel based.  For skincare, these items include hand lotions, hand sanitizers, and moisturizing creams.  When it comes to cosmetics, all items are made of liquid are prohibited from being stored in your carryon luggage, even your purse. This means that you need to remove all mascara, liquid foundation, lip gloss, and other liquid based cosmetics from your carryon luggage.  Other beauty products include shampoo, conditioner, hair spray, styling gel, mouthwash, and toothpaste.",
            "In addition to health and beauty products, there are a fairly large number of food and drink products that you must either leave at home, discard before you enter the airport security area, or pack in your checked luggage. For beverages, this includes all liquid beverages, even those that are not opened.  If you purchase a drink from a sterile restaurant or shopping store, past airport security, you will have to consume your drink before you begin boarding for your flight.",
            "When it comes to food, you will also find that, like most beverages, items with liquid in them are banned. These items include, but are not limited to jello, soup, pudding, and yogurt. If you need to have food or snacks with you, you will want to purchase something from the airport vending machines or bring a small, dry snack from home. These items are the safest and most convenient to have when snacking aboard an airplane.",
            "As you can easily see, there are an unlimited number of products, with a gel or liquid base, that you must place in your checked baggage.  However, there are a few exceptions to this new air travel rule. When it comes to drinks, the only drinks, allowed on the airplane with you and other travelers is infant formula or milk based products for babies.  While you can bring these items onboard, there is a good chance that they will be closely examined.",
            "Another exception includes eye care products and medications.  You are allowed to bring liquid medication onboard an airplane with you, as long as the medication is prescribed to you.  Airport security will likely verify that your name matches the name on the prescription bottle.  You can also bring onboard other non prescription products, including those needed for eye care; however, they must be no larger than four ounces in size. These items may include saline solution and eye drops.",

In the event that you are trying to store prohibited items, such as flammable objects, in your checked luggage, you will likely be asked to take the item to your car.

It is not uncommon for these items to be taken, melted, and forever discarded; however, some airports are beginning to profit from the sale of prohibited items.  A number of airports have sold these items, ranging from tools to lighters to scissors, themselves or with the assistance of an auction seller.  Regardless of which action is taken, it is safe to say that you will no longer be able to recuperate your confiscated belongings.",
            "Instead of just kissing your banned items goodbye, you will find that a number of airports have begun establishing onsite mail service centers.  These mail service centers are ideal for travelers who would be unable to make additional arrangements for their items, such as returning them to their vehicles.  With mail service centers, you will need to pay for the supplies, but you can easily have your items mailed to your home.  However, it is important to remember, that like all airports, the postal service also has a list of prohibited items. These items most commonly include flammable objects, such as lighters.",

The only thing is that not all medications are ideal for dogs; therefore, it is important to follow the advice of your vet.  As for treatment, many prescribe antibiotic and antifungal cream for rashes or infections that may have already developed on the skin.  Other preventative steps will likely be taken.

Reading all food labels is important for all food allergies, but it is especially important with wheat allergies and peanut allergies.  These are two common ingredients found in many foods.  Even when they aren\u2019t present, you may still see a warning that reads \u201cmay contain wheat,\u201d or \u201cmay contain nuts.\u201d  Also, be sure to ask whenever you visit an establishment where your food is prepared for you.

            "When it comes to determining where you can buy allergy relief medicine from, you will find that it depends on what you need or what to buy.  For example, prescription medicine requires a doctor\u2019s note.  On the other hand, if you are looking to use over-the-counter products, you will find that you have a bit more freedom, in terms of your buying options.  As for your buying options, a few of them are outlined below.",
            "As previously stated, prescription medication for allergies will first require the approval of a medical professional.  To get a prescription medication, it is advised that you schedule an appointment.  It is a great idea if you do have insurance, as it is usually affordable for you to seek professional advice.  If you prescription coverage, any type of prescription may work.  If you do not have prescription coverage or if it is only limited, inquire about generic brands, as they are often much more affordable.

Also, look for affordable prices, as not everyone charges the same amount of money.  If you must pay a percentage, instead of a traditional co-pay, or if you do not have prescription coverage, be sure to shop around.  Customer service should also be examined.  Make sure that you have all of your questions answered.  You should always leave a pharmacy more informed, not with more questions.",
            "As previously stated, you do have more freedom when buying over-the-counter allergy relief medicines.  If you are concerned with costs, one of the first places you should shop at is your local department store or discount store.  These stores are known for their great prices.  With that said, they do carry name brand medicines, but at more affordable prices.  Many off brands or store brands are also available or sale, even with allergy relief medicines.  Many department stores, like Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target, also have pharmacies.  This is great if you are looking to ask a pharmacist which over-the-counter allergy relief medicines are the best.",

Although most allergy sufferers do have a number of buying options, most feel more comfort when shopping with a pharmacy or drug store.  It is also important to restate that having a pharmacist on hand is nice, especially if you have any questions.",

When you experience a runny nose, stuffy nose, a cough, or chest congestion, there is likely something in particular that is triggering it.

            "If you decide to seek relief from your seasonal allergies without the use of a doctor, but still with medication, you will likely turn to over-the-counter products.  Before taking an over the counter product, be sure to read all warning labels and all information that is provided to you.  Some over-the-counter medications can react with others or have side effects.  If you want reassurance that you will be trying a safe product and one that is known to produce results, you may want to speak to any other seasonal allergy sufferers that you know, a pharmacist, or you can read reviews on over-the-counter products online.",

For example, The Weather Channel is known for outlining high pollen counts in certain areas. They often do so on live broadcasts as well as on their website.  If your area is impacted by high levels of pollen, it may be a wise idea to stay indoors or at least wear a protective mask.  Checking any pets that you may have is another great tip that many do not think of.

As for why you should avoid this approach if you suffer from a food allergy, it is because you may have another allergic reaction, which you are trying to prevent.  With that said, if you are suffering from seasonal allergies, pet allergies, mold and mildew allergies, certain foods may be able to provide you with relief.

For example, if you have allergies that are due to mold and mildew, avoid areas in your home where mold or mildew is present, like your basement.  If you suffer from allergies due to dust, consider hiring a professional cleaning service or you can clean more often, which should reduce the amount of dust that accumulates overtime.",

For that reason, if you suffer from food allergies, you will not want to just limit your consumption of foods, but you will want to completely eliminate the food or foods that you are allergic to from your diet.

For some individuals, over-the-counter allergy relief products just don\u2019t work.  Those who suffer from food allergies, like peanut allergies, may not only receive medicine from their doctor that can help with their symptoms, but they will also likely receive medicine that may one day save their life.",
            "Another pro or plus side to seeing a doctor if you suspect that you suffer from an allergy is that it should be easy for you to schedule an appointment.  If you have a regular doctor who you see on occasion, all you should have to do is schedule an appointment.  With that said, it may be more difficult for you if you are a new patient.  New patients often get the last appointments and some are even put on waiting lists.  Still, you can shop around for a good doctor.  Look for one that accepts your health insurance.  Someone in your town who practices medicine should have an opening soon.",
            "Although there are a number of pros or plus sides to seeking medical attention when you suspect that you may have an allergy, there are a number of cons or downsides to doing so as well.  One of those downsides is the cost.  If you do not have adequate health insurance, you may have high co-pays or high deductibles.  If you do not have health insurance, it can be costly to schedule an appointment with a doctor.  With that said, it is still a good idea to seek medical attention.  If you need to, look for doctors or healthcare establishments that are income based.  They can help you save money.  Also, see if you qualify for state run programs, such as Medicaid.  This is most important to do if you do have severe allergy symptoms.",
            "Time is another common downside to seeking medical attention when you are only experiencing a small number of non-severe allergy symptoms.  It is no secret that doctors don\u2019t always have the most convenient hours.  If you do not have enough time or if you cannot take time off from work, you may find it difficult to seek medical attention.  With that in mind, some clinics have flexible hours.  These hours may include being open on the weekends or late at least one night at week.  If you do experience severe allergy symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, you are advised to go to the hospital.",
            "Finally, some do not like seeking medical attention when they can treat themselves at home, because nothing may be done.  It is not uncommon for a doctor to recommend over-the-counter allergy relief products when symptoms are not severe.  You and many others sometimes view a visit to the doctor\u2019s office, in this type of case, as a waste of time and money.",

            "Although there are a number of steps that you can take to treat or manage allergies that are due to pets, it is first important to make sure that you do have a pet allergy.  Visit a healthcare provider or do your own experiments at home or when you are around animals. Do your symptoms get better when you are not near a pet?  If so, you may have a pet allergy.  Determining whether or not you do have pet allergies can help you save a lot of time and stress, should you actually not have an allergy.",
            "If you do have a pet allergy or if you truly suspect that you do, it is advised that you schedule a visit with your healthcare provider.  A doctor may recommend over-the-counter allergy relief medications for you.  They may also prescribe a medication, depending on your symptoms.  Although over-the-counter medicines and prescription medicines are all great ways to seek relief from allergies, it is also important to know that there are a number of natural steps that you can and should take.",
            "One of the best ways to deal with a pet allergy is to remove the pet or pets from your home.  If you aren\u2019t a pet owner, but if you have allergy symptoms when visiting friends or family, reconsider your choice to do so.  Of course, you can limit the amount of time you are there or reduce your visits, but you may want to consider doing something else instead.  Shopping, eating lunch, or having a cup of coffee are all great alternatives.",
            "If you are a pet owner who cannot bear to part with your pets, like if you consider them to be a member of your family, keep your pet or pets out of your bedroom.  The bedroom is the place where many individuals spend most of their time.  The last thing that you want to be doing is suffering from allergies when trying to get a good nights sleep.  If you are a visitor, as opposed to the pet owner, ask to move outside, if the weather is nice.  You can also ask to move to a room where the pets aren\u2019t allowed.",
            "Vacuuming as much as possible is another great way to relieve the symptoms of pet allergies.  If you own a cat or a dog, invest in a good, quality vacuum cleaner, namely one that uses HEPA technology.  There are also vacuum cleaners that are designed for pet owners.  They may be a good idea if you are suffering from pet allergies.  Many come with attachments that allow you to easily get pet air off of bedding and furniture.",
            "As previously stated, it is important to remember that you can suffer from pet allergies even if you aren\u2019t a pet owner.  If you know of someone who is a pet owner, like a close friend or family member, be sure to talk to them about your pet allergy.  Of course, they will not get rid of their pets just for you, but they may take proactive steps to make their home a safer place for you.  These steps may involve keeping their pets in another room or vacuuming before you come over.",

            "One of the first things that you will want to do is talk to your child about their food allergy.  This is most important to do with preschoolers and young elementary school aged children.  It is common for this age group to switch snacks or share snacks with their friends or classmates, but it isn\u2019t always safe to do so.  The younger that you have this conversation with your child, the better it will be.  For small children, be sure to discus your child\u2019s food allergy with them more than once.  For older children and teenagers, teach them how they can read food labels themselves.",
            "In addition to talking to your child, be sure to talk to anyone and everyone that comes into contact with your child.  This includes teachers, school nurses, daycare providers, relatives, and parents of friends.  A large number of food reactions happen outside of the home when a parent is not present.  If you are sending your child to visit family or a friend, it may be a wise idea to send your own bag of safe, approved snacks.",
            "As for feeding a child with food allergies at home, it is important to read all labels.  Some foods, even those that may not contain nuts or wheat, may still have a warning stating that these products may be found in the food.  If so, it is best to stay away.  It is also important that you read the labels of foods that your child will eat every time.  To some parents this may seem like a waste of time, but manufacturers are known to change their recipes and the ingredients that they use.  For that reason, it is better to be safe than sorry.",
            "When eating away from home with your child, like at a fast food restaurant, a nice sit down resultant, deli, or bakery, it is always a good idea to ask questions first.  This is most important to do at delis and bakeries.  Are all foods made on the same spot?  At a deli, is a different meat cutter used for meats and cheeses?  They should be if your child has allergies to milk and other dairy products.  Is there a chance that a certain food, like peanuts or wheat may have been used or even just casually made their way into other products?",
            "It is also important that you know how to handle an allergic reaction to food.  Be sure that those around you and your child know how to handle a food reaction as well.  If your child is given medication to take in the event of an allergic reaction, make sure that medication is with you and your child at all times.  At school or for daycare, give the medication to the school nurse or daycare provider.  If your child is visiting friends or family, be sure to give the medication to the adult and let them know when it needs to be used, if at all.",
            "If your child has an allergic reaction to something that they ate, it is important to determine right away if your child needs medical attention.  Many parents like to seek medication attention for their kids even if it appears that they are okay.  This is more than possible to do, especially if the food allergy is relatively new or if it is the first couple of times that you are dealing with an allergic reaction.",

Of course, you can try your own experiments at home, but you will want to proceed with caution.  This is important if you think the cause of your skin rash or allergic reaction is food, as your symptoms can become much more severe.  That is why you are advised against performing your own allergy tests at home, but if you do, just make sure that you aren\u2019t alone when doing so.",
            "Once you are able to determine what is causing your skin to have an allergic reaction, you can better go about seeking relief.  First, over-the-counter allergy medications may be examined.  There are also lotions and creams that can provide you with relief from itching and or hives.  If you visit your doctor, he or she may be able to recommend specific products to you.  If you do not visit a doctor, you should be able to still speak with one of your pharmacists to ask for their input on a certain over-the-counter allergy relief product, free of charge.",
            "It is also important to know that you can seek relief without the use of over-the-counter products.  For example, oatmeal when mixed with one cup of boiling water, let cooled, and then strained can provide relief to those who have hives.  The water extracted from the oatmeal can be dabbed on the skin.  You can also reduce your skin reactions by eliminating or significantly reducing your trigger factors.  For example, if you are a pet owner who cannot bear to part with your pet, consider not holding them or petting them without gloves, keeping them out of your bedroom, and investing in an air purifier.",
            "As highlighted above, there are a number of different reasons why you may have an allergic reaction to the skin.  Regardless of the cause though, there are a number of ways that you can go about seeking relief.",

Archers have been an indispensable part of Egyptian, Indian, Greek and Persian civilization.  These archers were highly adorned and respected; in fact special training was provided to people who wanted to master the art of archery.",
            "Bows and arrows are the main constituents of archery. Studies have shown that the bows were developed in either early Mesolithic age or late Paleolithic age.  Pines were used for making arrows.",
            "Bows are of different types such as Longbow, shortbow, flatbow, recurve bow, crossbow and compound bow. Longbow as the name suggests is very long; the length of the bow is equal to the height of the user and in some cases even exceeds the height of the user.   The limb of the Flatbow is wider and the cross-section is rectangular in shape.",
            "Shortbow is shorter in length; it is light weight and has a short range. It was basically used for hunting purpose.  In crossbow the limbs are mounted in a horizontal manner and not in a vertical manner. The compound bow is designed in such as manner that the archer is at his ease while mounting the bow.",
            "An arrow is made up of shaft; it has an arrowhead which is at the front portion of the arrow.

The posture of the body, the eye and the way the archer is holding the bow should be proper.",
            "Sight shooting and instinctive shooting are the two methods adopted by an archer while shooting n arrow.  In instinctive shooting the archer has to completely concentrate on the target while shooting the arrow.  It requires a lot of practice.  Whereas in case of sight shooting the archer can adjust the pins which are there on the bows to target an object, his is relatively easy. Previously instinctive shooting was the norm but at present sight shooting is more preferred.",
            "As the civilization started advancing materialistically, people started thinking of developing some mechanism which was more lethal and more effective in comparison to bows and arrows. Development of firearms was a step in this direction; it made bows and arrows completely obsolete.",
            "Bows and arrows which were extensively used in wars by the soldiers gave way to firearms. Those kingdoms which did not possess firearms started losing their stronghold and were defeated in the war filed. The firearms had many advantages over bows and arrows. They had long range, they were more lethal, using them did not require lots of training and no major skill was required to use this weapons.",
            "Today archery has become a sporting activity; some even use it for recreational purposes. Although today archery has lost its sheen but we should not forget that it has played a pivotal role in shaping human civilization."

Compound designs use elliptical or cam wheels on limb ends to optimize leverage that is exerted by the user.",
            "Crossbow: Crossbows are a variation of a general bow design. Here are the limbs are mounted horizontally. The limb design is either a recurve or a compound but the concept of shooting remains the same.

These oils are called essential oils, which are used and combined with other ingredients to produce perfumes, lotions, and other beauty, skin care and hair care products. In fact, all the products with your favorite plant scent such as Rose, Lavender and Chamomile are results of the practice of aromatherapy. It is said that aromatherapy can also improve one's mood, lightening it up and easing the stress. This is perhaps why the technique is also used in massage parlors and spas to relax customers.",

Plant oils are used in their various religious set-ups and even in the burying of their dead. In fact, archaeologists who dug up tombs in Egypt have found plant extracts and remains with embalmed bodies. It was also the Egyptians, who first used the plant extracts for cosmetic and aromatic purposes.",

Unknown to many, aromatherapy has a lot of branches. One of those branches is Home Therapy, which deals with the use of the practice for self-treatment as well as in the use of it in making perfumes and cosmetics. It is also used in medical practice and this branch is called the clinical aromatherapy. Lastly, the branch that deals with the use of aromatherapy in the psychology of odors and its effects in people is called the Aromachology.",

Unknown to many, lavender can also be used in the treatment of wounds as well as in the enhancement of memory. It can also be used as a sleeping aid as it helps relieve anxiety and insomnia.",

Does it really calm the nerves and relax the muscles?",

Some also used the oils as medicines while the women used them as perfumes and cosmetic. In fact, the word perfume is thought to have come from the latin word fumum, which means smoke. There are claims that men also use fragrance like women but they have an interesting method of doing it. They will place a solid cone of perfume on their heads, which they will gradually melt until the perfume and scent cover their whole bodies.",

Still the use of plant oils as perfume took a life of its own and soon Megallus made a perfume from myrrh, which is a fatty-oil. His perfume called the Megaleion not only had aromatic benefits, it can also heal wounds and has an anti-inflammatory property towards the skin. It was also the Greeks that established the medicinal purposes of plants. In fact, the father of medicine, Hippocrates, practiced the use of plants for its aromatic and medicinal benefits.",

Avicenna, a Persian, was the one who created the prototype, which allowed steam and vapor from the plant to cool down so that it can be extracted better and faster than other distilling machines. Because of this invention, the focus once again went to the benefits of essential plant oils."

Without the intricacies of modern healing, people back then only resort to traditional and alternative medicine in relieving physical pain. But, due to the emergence of modern science in the field of medicine, this tradition of healing using natural resources have slowly disappeared.",
            "But today, with the trend of going back to the natural and to the basic, aromatherapy is becoming quite popular in the world of healing because of its therapeutic properties. Usually, aromatherapy involves the use of aromatherapy oils derived from various parts of plants. These aromatherapy oils are believed to contain therapeutic properties that greatly help patients to recover and heal eventually.",

            "The most common form of using aromatherapy oil is through inhalation done by placing a tiny drop of your chosen aromatherapy oil on a piece facial tissue or soft cloth. Aside from inhaling it using a cloth or a tissue, you can also reap the benefits of aromatherapy oil through steam inhalation that involves the use the aromatherapy oil dropped in bowl of hot water.

You can do this by placing a few drops of the aromatherapy oil on cotton balls and place them in locations where insects usually thrive like doorways and windows.",
            "Since there are seemingly countless ways where one can use aromatherapy oils, it is a must to familiarize yourself what are the things you should consider before buying or purchasing aromatherapy oils.",
            "- Conduct a little research before using specific aromatherapy oil. Since each kind of aromatherapy oil has varying therapeutic qualities, you cannot ensure that the product you're planning to buy will not cause you any harm. Make sure that you know what are the properties to be used for a specific purpose of illness.",

If you see an essential oil that is placed in clear bottle or a plastic bottle, then disregard it because light has probably lack or excessive light might have damaged the intrinsic properties of the aromatherapy oil. Make sure that you buy aromatherapy oils that are placed in colored bottles to ensure quality.",
            "- Make sure that you check and double check label. By checking the label, you can ensure that the aromatherapy oil you are planning to buy is pure. Avoid buying those bottles that say \"perfume\" or \"fragrance oil\" because these do not contain pure aromatherapy oils extracted from plants.",
            "- Examine the bottle carefully for dust and expiration date. If the bottle has dust on its cap or around its container, don\u2019t buy it because this indicates that the product you're planning to buy is old and have probably lost its aromatic scent and healing properties.",
            "- Consider the price. Since pure aromatherapy oils are extracted and distilled from various plants, they prices range drastically. Bear in mind that pure therapeutic aromatherapy oils that are derived from exotic plants are more expensive than those derived from common plants."

            "Causes of edema:",
            "Edema may arise from inhaling smoke, MI, CHF, Myocarditis, excessive I.V. intakes of fluid, Valvular disease, overdose of drugs, such as morphine, barbiturates, and heroin. Acute edema arises from ARDS (Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome) and Atherosclerosis.",
            "The lack of heart pumping can cause stress to the chest, which when the chest is scarred it affects the spines structure and mobility. Overarching the back is where back pain starts, since the chest is restricted from scarring and/or edema.",

Of course, edema can lead to major problems, such as Hypernatremia, Digoxin Toxicity, Hypokalemia, Excessive Fluid, and Pulmonary Blockage of the arteries, (Embolism), which starts blood clotting and affects blood circulation. Hypokalemia will decrease potassium intake that is required by blood. What happens is the decrease of potassium to the blood causes excessive excretion of fluids that lead to the muscles, which cause weakness. The back pain is not necessary the issue at this stage, since the heart is the starting point, which could lead to cardiac arrest.",
            "When acute edema is present, experts will often restrict fluid intake, while administering I.V. fluids to substitute. Oxygen and meds are prescribed. Often the doctor will request that the patient remain consistent in a high position, such as \u201cFowler\u2019s.\u201d",

            "Experts will request that the patient limit fluid intake, and join in oxygen therapy. Since edema causes excessive fluid buildup, isometric exercises, and bed, rest is required. Isometric workouts is the process of pushing muscles next to a sturdy surface, whereas the muscles are put under tension, yet restricted from contractions. The exercises are recommended in a variety of medical treatments when back pain is involved.",
            "Edema also affects the joints, cartilages, muscles etc, which can cause tenderness, ulcers of the legs, changes of stasis, and so forth. Edema affects the veins found in the neck as well, which is one of the leading starts of back pain. To avoid traveling into the heart cavity and discussing heart conditions, I will sum up edema and the causes of back pain.",
            "As I mentioned earlier, back pain starts with edema since when the heart is not pumping blood it affects the connective tissues, ligaments, tendons, muscles, cells, joints, etc. As you can see, when the skeleton elements are targeted pain will occur from swelling and inflammation. The cause of back pain then starts with excessive fluid buildup emerging from acute edema and/or peripheral edema conditions.",
            "To learn more about edema and back pain consider tendons, ligaments, disks, joints, connective tissues, neurological disorders, and so on.",
            "Back pain has affected millions of people, yet the leading causes emerge from nerve and musculoskeletal disorders. Still, many diseases and disorders can cause back pain, including edema. In fact, when doctors discover musculoskeletal and nerve disorders, they often link one of the potential causes to edema."

            "Did you know that many doctors miss areas of concern that could lead to cures? Did you know that back pain is common, yet many doctors fail to see the cause? The answer is simple. The reason is most medical doctors have little experience in the system of healing so to speak. Rather many doctors focus on prescribing medicines and searching for answers, which many times rest in front of them. Don\u2019t get me wrong, good doctors reach everywhere, yet these people lack educational knowledge of the spinal column, central nervous system and so on. As well, these people fail to see that many causes of back pain rests in misaligned bones, or spine. Of course, diseases may cause back pain as well. Sitting too long, lack of stretch exercises, etc, all cause lower back pain.",

X-rays will show back conditions, however since doctors review all areas, except the alignment of the bones and spine, thus most times the x-rays only reveal what the doctor wants to see.

The back problem may be listed as slip disk in some instances, yet the pain often challenges doctors diagnose since a sharp, electrical shock-like and distressing ache starts at the back and then travels to the legs. Sometimes the pain is intermittent, while other times the pain may be chronic. The particular problem often requires surgery to correct. Sciatica according to few experts is one of the worst backaches endured, since even when the pain has mild pain it is difficult to bend forward and over to tie a shoe. The problem rests in the spine, joints, and connective elements of the spinal column that links to the entire body.",
            "The spinal column makes up muscles, bones, central nerves, etc. What holds the spine together is disks, connective tissues, tendons, ligaments, etc? When a person stands erect, the spine\u2019s elements will join to apply tension. You can visualize the tension by considering how a string will respond when you pull it down. The changes assist the body in mobility; as well, it determines how the body responds to movement.",

The hip joints connect to the pelvis and each element joins with the spinal column at the triangle bone in the lower back and at the baseline of the spine that joins the hipbones on either side and forms part of the pelvis. (Sacrum)",
            "The large bones attach to the legs, which provide us strength and support to the vertical spinal column. We have thick bones that start at the opposite side of the thick cord of nerve tissues (Spinal Cord) that is near the neck. Along this area, the joints are thick and the bones start to thin and shrink.  The spinal cord is a \u201cthick whitish\u201d nerve cord surrounded by tissues and extends from the base of the brain and continues to the spinal column, giving mount to a pair of spinal nerves that contribute the body.",
            "Combined these elements give us the ability to move and provides flexibility. In addition, the organs are directed by these elements.",
            "The spine is held up by the larger group of bones at the lower region, smaller base, and the top architectures. Stress occurs at the area, since below this region larger muscles work by directing and sparking movement. This is how the legs are able to move, which brute stress is applied to the vertebrae. At the back, we also have a lumbar spinal disk. The disk is affected by the brute stress, since each time we bend and sit, we are applying more than 500 pounds to this area, yet it stretches to a \u201csquare inch\u201d around the disks and per count along the area."

            "When doctors consider back or hip fractures they often consider trauma, maturity, osteoporosis, osteomyelitis, multiple myeloma, immobility, steroids, Cushing syndrome, malnutrition, bone tumors, and so on.",
            "Osteomyelitis is a bone disease, which causes inflammation of bones and marrow. The problem often starts with infections. Osteoporosis is also a bone disease, which occurs amongst women, especially after menopause. The bones after menopause often become highly permeable or porous, which causes easy breaks and slow healing processes.",
            "Once the doctor finds the cause, Pathophysiology is considered, which includes assessment of the fracture itself. Does the fracture transpire at what time stress is pressed on the bones, which the bones cannot hold the weight? Doctors will consider if they are capable of localizing the tissues around the injuries to avert edema, muscle spasms, ecchymosis, hemorrhage, nerve compression and so on.",
            "Edema then will cause back pain, since it is excessive fluids that buildup between the cells of tissue. Ecchymosis is the fleeting of blood that travels into groups of cells into an organism (Tissues), which are caused from ruptured, or breaks of blood vessels.",
            "How do they assess?",
            "Doctors usually assess fractures by reviewing false motions, pain caused from motion, edema, tenderness, immobility, crepitus, deformity, ecchymosis, paresthesia, and so on. If one leg is apparently shorter than the other is, likely a fractured hip is the cause. Paresthesia often causes tingling, creeping, or pricking sensations, which usually an obvious cause is not present.",
            "How do doctors find fractures?",
            "Doctors often use Hematology tests or X-rays to find fractures. X-rays helps the doctor find breakage in continuity of the bones, while Hematology assists in spotting decreases in HCT and Hgb.",
            "Once the doctor notes the medical condition, he/she will recommend medical supervision, nurse interventions, etc to treat the condition. Management often includes diets, exercise, etc, yet it depends on the type of fracture.",
            "DO not try this at home unless your doctor has authorized treatment first.",
            "Diet of any kind is ok, so many think, yet some people lack vitamins, minerals, etc, while others have high loads. The diet set up from fractures may include high protein diet, high vitamin, low calcium, and increases in fluids. It is amazing that a doctor would request low calcium diets, especially when calcium is essential for building bones, yet in some instances low volumes of calcium is mandatory.",
            "Management may include elevation of the legs, especially if the patient has a hip fracture. Exercise includes ROM and isometric. Stretch exercises are best suited for back injuries.",
            "Hip injuries can cause back pain. If doctors find fractures it could lead to complications, such as pressure sores, \u201cdeep vein thrombosis,\u201d avascular tissue death or necrosis of the femoral top, renal (Kidney) lithiasis, hypovolemic shock, fat and pulmonary (Lungs) embolism, osteomyelitis, cubicle syndrome, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia.",

When herpes simplex has not developed into AIDS (Not that it will in all cases), the outbreaks often occur sporadically, and causes tingling and burning sensations in the vagina or penis region. A greenish-yellow discharge will follow. The symptoms will start, skip a few months, and develop again if the patient is overly distressed. Doctors usually treat herpes simplex by using medications, such as acyclovir.",

The muscles also form as adenosine Triphosphate, ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate Phosphate), and hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is reactions that occur with fluids. Thus, chemical reactions emerge with compound reactions and causes decomposition. In addition, it reacts by producing two or more additional compounds, which may include a combo of glucose and/or minerals, etc.",
            "Adenosine Triphosphate is components of our RNA. The compounds of adenine and organic ribose sugar, which makes up the components of nucleic acid and energy, which is carried via molecules. Ribose has five-carbon sugars, which is discovered in living cells. Its constituents, RNA, plays a vital part in the metabolically structure, since compounds include nucleic acids, riboflavin, and ribonucleotides exist. Riboflavin is necessary for growth and energy. The pigments are made up of orange-yellow crystals, which derive from Vitamin B complex. Riboflavin is vital to particular enzymes also. Riboflavin is sometimes known as Vitamin G and lactoflavin as well.",
            "We achieve tone from our muscles, since they act as retainers. The action causes the muscles to hold back a degree of contractions, which breaks down the transmission of nerve impulses or white crystalline compounds that release from the ends of neuron fiber (Acetylcholine) by use of enzymes known as cholinesterase.",
            "The enzymes of the brain, blood, and heart decomposes acetylcholine, breaking it down into acetic (Vinegary) acids and choline, which suppresses its' stimuli and affects the nerves. The action is sometimes known as acetyl-cholinesterase. Enzymes are proteins, which are complex. The elements produce from the living cells and promote specific biochemical reactions. Enzymes act as catalysts.",
            "Each element outlined makes up the parts of the body that when affected can lead to back pain. For instance, if the muscle tone fails to hold back contractions, and breaking down of nerve impulse transmission at a given time, the muscles are overexerted, which causes back pain."

            "At the spinal column are the elongated columns of bones, which the thoracic ribs support. The thoracic ribs push the bones the length of bone structure. The ribs join with the spinal column in various areas.  Joints connect with these ribs, which are field of studies, since they often wear and tear, causing gradual degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis.",
            "Osteoarthritis is defined in medical terms as a metabolically dysfunction of the bones. The results of the drops in our life-sustaining chemicals, which promote activity causes the bones to reduce mass whilst increasing porosity. The disease can cause osteoporosis to set in and intensify risks of fractures.",
            "How do doctors consider osteoarthritis and/or osteoporosis?",
            "Doctors often consider etiology aspects, including hyperthyroidism, deficiency of estrogen, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, immobility, increases in phosphorus, liver illness, lack of exercise, deficiency of calcium and protein, deficiency of Vitamin D, and bone marrow conditions. Wear and tear of specific joints as mentioned above is also linked to osteoarthritis.",
            "According to the Pathophysiology in medical terms, osteoarthritis is assessed by considering the rates of bone resorption that exceeds the rate of the bone structure or formation. Experts will often test the patient while considering rises in \u201cbone resorption\u201d and increases in phosphate (Salt of Phosphoric Acids) that stimulates the parathyroid activities. Phosphoric acids will form ester, which emerge from reactions via alcohol, metal, and radicals. If estrogen shows a decrease in resorption, it could also show traits of osteoarthritis.",
            "What are the symptoms?",
            "The symptoms may emerge from Kyphosis or otherwise known as Dowager\u2019s hump. Back pain, as well as damage to the thoracic and lumbar may be present. In addition, the patient may loose height, and demonstrate an unsteady walk. Joint pain and weakness is also present.",
            "How do doctors determine if osteoarthritis is present?",
            "First, they assess the symptoms and then request tests, such as x-rays and photon absorptiometry. X-rays of course helps the doctor to locate thinning of bone structures, porous structures in the bones, and rises in vertebral curvatures. The photon tests help the expert to spot decreases in minerals.",
            "What if I test positive for osteoarthritis:",
            "If you test positive then the doctor considers treatment. The treatment often includes management, interventions, and further assessments. Further assessments help the doctor weed down potential complications. The complications often include pathologic fractures, which are complex.",
            "How does the doctor manage osteoarthritis?",
            "No two people are alike therefore medical management varies. Yet, most doctors set up a high-calcium, protein diet, as well as increasing minerals, vitamin regimens, and boron.",
            "Doctors may include in the management scheme alcohol and caffeine restrictions. In addition, the scheme may compose tolerated exercise, monitoring, lab studies, specifically studies on phosphorus and calcium. Doctors may also include into your management scheme estrace increase, i.e. estradiol or estrogen intake. Supplements with calcium carbonates (Os-CAL) are often prescribed as well. Additional treatment includes mineral and vitamin regimens, exercise, and so on. Many doctors prescribe Aldactazide, Dyazide, which is a thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. Over-the-counter meds, such as the NAID-based painkillers is prescribed as well. Prescriptions often include ibuprofen, Motrin, Indocin, Clinoril, Feldene, Ansaid, or flurbiprofen, voltaren, naproxen, Dolobid, and naprosyn is often prescribed.",
            "How intervention helps:",
            "Interventions assisted by nursing staff include balanced diets, pain and musculoskeletal assessment, monitoring, meds, home care instructions, posture training, body mechanic support and training, and so on. The patient should also be informed about osteoarthritis as outlined by the Foundation of Osteoarthritis. In addition, the doctor is advised to allow the patient to express his/her emotions, feelings, etc in relation to the illness."

The common conditions are linked to cholelithiasis, or the start of gallstones. You may wonder how back pain starts from this disorder, yet if you continue reading, you can see how it affects the spine. Gallbladder infections can cause lower back pains, specifically sharp pain, since it is a membranous sac located in the muscles. The sac stores in bile in the liver.",
            "Cholelithiasis may derive from bile pigments, obesity, cholesterol, estrogen therapy, calcium stones, and infections of the gallbladder. The disease can cause chest pain, indigestion, and so on. Cholelithiasis also causes episodic pain from colicky symptoms, which expend to the epigastric, which lies up or over the abdomen and radiates to the shoulders and back. The worst condition puts the patient at risk of jaundice. If the condition continues, the patient will feel repeated spurts of nausea, which causes vomiting. Flatulence, steatorrhea (Excess fats in stools), belching, pruritus, ecchymosis, dark urine, and discolored stools are signs of Cholecystitis. Ecchymosis is the fleeing of blood, which travels to the tissues and onto the ruptured, or fissure blood vessels. We see back pain issues arising since the sensory nerves submit messages, which travel to the muscles. Once the message arrives at the muscles it continues to travels to the organs and blood vessels. The process continues to the skin and at last reaches the brain. Motor and sensory signals are necessary to submit actions that promote healthy spinal columns, which if these signals are interrupted, thus back pain occurs.",
            "During testing doctors will search for obstructions of the biliary trees, kidney stones, and distention of the bile duct and calcui. Liver scans, ultrasounds, gallbladder testing, and cholangiograms help the doctor to spot such symptoms. Hematology is tests that help the doctor to note increases in the white blood cells. (WBC) Blood chemistry shows increases in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, lipase, AST, and bilirubin transaminase. The condition can lead to further complications, which include pancreatitis, (Pancreas inflammation) hemorrhaging, peritonitis, cirrhosis, and leads to the perforations of the intestinal organs.",

The elements are optimally live within the mediums of alkaline and occur from high volumes of concentrations into the liver, bones, placenta, and kidneys. Thoracic spinal column is an element that protects the vital organs. Thoracic protects the backbone also. Thoracic also shields the lungs, liver, and the heart. As you can see the disorder or the symptoms emerging from the disorder spread near this area posing thus, threat to the spine.",
            "To correct serious conditions, laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy, cholecystectomy, and choledochostomy is considered. The surgical procedures are only conducted in the worst conditions, since doctors use nurse intervention strategies to avert the symptoms and condition from reaching further complications.",
            "If you notice, the symptoms inside this disorder include obesity, chest pain, colicky symptoms, and so on. The symptoms cause back pain, since when chest pain starts it adds additional stress, which affects the muscles, joints, connective tissues, ligaments, tendons, cartilages, and so on. The pain emerges from overloads of stress, specifically to the tendons, ligaments, connective tissues, and joints.",

The conditions noted in hip fractures include intracapsular, Intertrochanteric, and extracapsular. Each problem rests within the blood vessels, yet it starts with fractures. Blood vessels make up the arteries, capillary, and veins. As you can see chest pain can lead to back pain, since the blood vessels travel. Overexerting the bones can cause fractures, which lead to depression and related symptoms.",

Abolish reflexes are reduced if the fracture is at the lower region of the back. Muscle spasms and muscle reflexes often occur at the higher area of the back. If you have such fracture, bed rest is recommended to reduce the pain. If acute back conditions exist, experts will need to assess the problem. Broken back is an acute condition, which you should avoid rolling, or logrolling.",
            "Fractures include the stable and unstable breaks. If the fracture is unstable, it can severely damage the spine. In such case, the doctor will surgically correct the problem or recommend that the patient wear a cast. The damage can tear the nerves. If you feel you have broken your back, you are wise to avoid atypical movement, since it will progress the problem when pressure is applied to the area.",

Bad falls can break the coccyx, which can sit in coccygodynia. Below the triangular bones at the lower back and near the baseline of the spinal column, the hips are joined with bones that set on either side and form parts that connect to the pelvis. (Sacrum) This area joins with five merging bones, which are fused with the sacrum and is commonly known as the coccyx.",

            "Fractures can also invent bursitis. When one of the bursa is disrupted it will inflame, swell, and cause pain. The problem emerges from friction. Friction is often increased when bursitis starts, since instead of separating particular tissues, the fluids emerging from bursa stand in the way. Bursitis includes obturator internis, trochanteric, and ischial. Bursa conditions such as the named rest near the buttocks, lower back, and hip.",
            "To avoid bursitis you may want to avoid sitting, standing, or lying in one position at all times. Instead, shift your resting states. Doctors will often inject a mixture of anesthetic lidocaine and steroids to correct bursitis.",

            "The disk at the back spinal column divides the skeletal structures. Disk does not compose blood vessels or nerves like other elements of the skeletal structure. Instead, disks are made up of fat, water, and tissues that connect to the skeletal structure. During all hours of the day, the disks leak water, which is caused from forces of gravity. For instance, when we sit it is a gravity force in action, which one might think that it takes little effort to sit, but contrary to the notion, it is adding a lot of weight to the spine and disk.",
            "The disk restores water that has leaked out during the day, yet the water is restored at slower paces. Fat and water is balanced in the disk, yet when it is not it causes a person to shrink height. Fat and water inside disks are thick, yet when a person starts aging, the substances begin to thin. When fat and water begins to thin, it can lead to osteoarthritis. Thinning water and fat of the disk is also the leading cause of back pain, especially at the lower region.",
            "Disks exterior are covered by \u201cAnnulus Fibrosis.\u201d Sometimes the connective tissues lead to abnormal thickening, which scars the tissue. Usually injury follows, then infection, and moves to restrained oxygen intake. Surgery is often the result. The inner area of the disk is shielded by \u201cNucleus Pulposis.\u201d The pulp makes up the hub of the disk, which is polished and soft. The disks make up the primary supporting force that regulates the spinal column, bones, muscles, etc.",
            "When the disk is not protecting the spinal structures it is often dehydrated, pressured, or deformed. The disk has strength that combines with flexibility to withstand high loads of pressure, yet when that flexibility and strength is interrupted, it can result to herniated disk slips, or other injuries.",
            "Slipped disks in medical terms are known as HNP. (Herniated Nucleus Pulposa) As outlined the intervertebral disks are ruptured, which interrupts the nucleus pulposa. In medical terms, slipped disks can include L4, L5, which is Lumbrosacral and C5-7, which is Cervical. L4 is a single area of the spinal column and disks, which defines the numerical disk ruptured.",
            "Slipped disks are caused from accidents, trauma, strain of the back and neck, lifting heavy objects, disk degeneration, weak ligaments, and congenital deformity of the bones. Disk degeneration is outlined in this article.",
            "Symptoms:",
            "Lumbrosacral will show apparent symptoms, such as acute lower back pain, which radiates to the buttocks and down to the leg. The person will feel weak, numb, or tingling that stretches to the leg and foot. Ambulation also causes pain.",
            "If cervical disk problems are present, the patient will feel stiffness around the neck. As well, the symptoms will make the patient feel weak, numb, and he/she will feel tingling around the hands. Neck pain often generates pain, extending it to the arms and onto the hands, which cause weakness to the upper region of the body. The weakness often targets the triceps and biceps, which become atrophy. The lumbar is affected also, which the patient will find it difficult to straighten the back.",
            "What happens when a disk is slipped and/or broken the annulus fibrosis reacts by pushing its substance into the hollow spacing between the spinal column. The spinal column is made up of nerves, which travel to various parts of the body, including the brain. These nerves are affected when the disk is slipped. Learn more about the Central Nerve System (CNS) to relate to slipped disks. First, understand how the joints and connective tissues can cause back pain."

        "summary": "",
        "content": [
            "When considering back pain we must concern ourselves with its variants. For instance, back pain can start with slip disks, which in medical terms is called \u201cHerniated nucleus pulposa.\u201d (HNP) Doctors define slip disks as ruptures of the \u201cintervertebral disk.\u201d The intervertebral rests between the vertebrae (Spinal Column) of the backbone.",
            "The interruption has variants, including the \u201cLumbrosacral,\u201d (L4 and L5) as well as cervical C5-7. The cervical is at the neck and belongs to other parts of the back and neck as well. When doctors consider slip disks they often look through etiology, which includes neck and back strains, trauma, congenital/inborn bone malformation, heavy lifting, degenerated disks, and/or weakness of ligaments.",
            "After carefully considering, etiology doctors consider Pathophysiology, which includes protrusions of the \u201cnucleus pulposus.\u201d The center connects to the column or spinal canal and perhaps compressing the spinal cord or the nerve core, or roots, which causes back pain. If the spinal cord is compressed restraining the roots and cord often back pain, numbness, and the motor functions may fail.",
            "The assessments in medical terms are based on Lumbrosacral, which may include acute or chronic pain at the lower back. The pain may spread out to the buttocks and move toward the legs. The person may feel weakness, as well as numbness. In addition, such pain can cause tingling around the legs and foot. The final assessment may include ambulation, which emerges from pain.",
            "The cervical is considered. The symptoms experts look for is neck rigidity, deadness, weakness, and \u201ctingling of the\u201d hands. If the neck pain spreads the pain down to the arms and continue to the hands, experts will consider slip disks. Yet other symptoms may occur, such as weakness that affects the farthest points, or the higher boundaries of the body. The lumbar curves is at the lower back region and is situated in the loins or the smaller area of the back, which doctors consider also, especially if the patient has difficult straightening this area with the curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and away from the area influenced.",
            "When doctors consider back pain, they will review the diagnostics after conducting a series of tests. Diagnostics may arise from tendon reflex, x-rays, EMG, myelograms, CSF, and/or Las\u00e9que signs. CSF helps the doctor to analyze the increases in protein while EMG assists experts in viewing the involvement of the spinal nerves. X-rays are used to help experts see the narrow disk space. Tendon reflexes are tested, which the doctors use tests to look deep into the depressed region, or the absent upper boundary reflexes, or in medical lingo the Achilles' reactions or reflex. Myelograms assist the expert in seeing if the spinal cord is compressed. The tests start if the Las\u00e9que signs show positive results behind etiology findings, Pathophysiology, assessments, and so on.",
            "How doctors manage slip disks:",
            "Doctors prescribe management in medical schemes to isolate or relieve back pain. The management schemes may include diet whereas the calories are set according to the patient\u2019s metabolic demands. The doctor may increase fiber intake, as well as force fluids.",
            "Additional treatment or management may include hot pads, moisture, etc, as well as hot compressions. Doctors often recommend pain meds as well, such as those with NAID. The pain meds include Motrin, Naproxen, Dolobid, or Diflunisal, Indocin, ibuprofen, and so on. Additional meds may include muscle Relaxers, such as Flexeril and Valiums. The common Relaxers are diazepam and cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, which diazepam is valiums and the other Flexeril.",
            "Orthopedic mechanisms are also prescribed to reduce back pain, which include cervical collars and back braces."

            "The skeletal bones make up more than 200 short, long, irregular, and flat structures. Inside the bones is calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and RBCs, or marrow, which produces and generate red blood cells. The bones work along side the muscles. The muscles and bones afford support, defense for the internal organs, and locomotion.",
            "The skeletal muscles are our source of mobility, which supports the posture. The muscles work alongside the posture by shortens and tighten it. The bones attach to the muscles via tendons. The muscle then starts to contract with stimulus of muscle fibers via a motor nerve cell, or neuron. The neurons consist of axon, cell bodies, and dendrites, which transport to the nerve impulses and are the essential makeup of our functional components within the larger system of nerves. (Central Nervous System-CNS) CNS is a network or system of nerve cells, fibers, etc, that conveys and transmits sensations to the brain, which carries on to the \u201cmotor impulses\u201d and onto the organs and muscles.",
            "Skeletal muscles supply movement for the body and the posture; as well, the skeletal muscles also submit energies to create contractions that form from ATP or adenosine Triphosphate and hydrolysis, ADP or adenosine Diphosphate and finally phosphate.",
            "The skeletal muscles also preserve muscle tone. What happen are the skeletal acts as a retainer by holding back a degree of contractions and breaking down acetylcholine by cholinesterase to relax the muscles? Muscles are made up of ligaments.",
            "Ligaments are robust bands combined with collagen threads or fiber that connect to the bones. The bands, fiber, and bones join to encircle the joints, which gives one a source of strength. Body weight requires cartilages, joints, ligaments, bones, muscles, etc to hold its weight. Next to ligaments are tendons. Tendons are ligaments and muscles combined, since it connects to the muscles and are made of connective proteins, or collagen. Tendons however do not possess the same flexibility as the ligaments do. Tendons make up fiber proteins that are found in cartilages, bones, skin, tendons, and related connective tissues.",
            "Joints are the connective articulated junctions between the bones. Joints connect to two bones and its plane and provide stability as well as locomotion. ROM is the degree of joint mobility, which if ROM is interrupted, the joints swell, ache, and cause pain. The pain often affects various parts of the body, including the back. Joints connect with the knees, elbow, skull, bones, etc, and work between the synovium. Synovium is a membrane. The membrane lines the inner plane of the joints. Synovium is essential since it supplies antibodies. The antibodies combined with this membrane create fluids that reach the cartilages. The fluids help to decrease resistance, especially in the joints. Synovium works in conjunction with the cartilages and joints.",
            "Cartilage is the smooth plane between the bones of a joint. The cartilage will deteriorate with restricted ROM or lack of resistance in the weight bearing joints. This brings in the bursa. Bursa is a sac filled with fluid. Bursa assists the joints, cartilages, bones, and synovium by reducing friction. Bursa also works by minimizing the risks of joints rubbing against the other. In short, bursa is padding.",
            "If fluids increase, it can cause swelling, and inflammation in turn causing body pain, and including back pain. Sometimes the pain starts at the lower back, yet it could work around various areas of the body.  The assessments in this situation revolve around symptoms, including pain, fatigue, numbness, limited mobility, joint stiffness, fevers, swelling, and so on. The results of skeletal muscle difficulties can lead to muscle spasms, poor posture, skeletal deformity, edema, inflammation, and so on. As you see from the medical versions of the skeletal muscles, back pain results from limited ROM, joint stiffness, etc."

In short, the first time your back started hurting is the sign. You want to pinpoint when the first pain started. Once you pinpoint the starting date, you will need to consider what inspired your back pain. For instance, did you fall? Were you in a motorized accident?",
            "Once you find the trigger of your back pain, you want to consider the symptoms. Did you feel pain? Did you feel weak? Was your back stiff or numb?",
            "Now you can use the indicators to discover where the pain started. Did the pain start at the lower back? Was the pain at the top area? Did the pain cause additional pain, such as around the neck? Was the pain intermittent? Did the pain consistently cause stress? Did the pain shoot to other areas of the body?",

Rest is a common treatment doctor prescribes to reduce back pain. I am a fan to chiropractor support, yet some people have issues with this notion, therefore if you feel a chiropractor can benefit you, seek support. Massage and physical therapy is also recommended to reduce back pain. In many areas, massage therapists are available, which charge reasonable fees. Check your areas to learn more about massage therapy. Common stretch exercises can reduce back pain, which has emerged from tension. If you overworked the muscles, you may want to rest and do a few exercises later.",

The muscles are at the top of the upper arm bones, and below the shoulder joints. Rotator cuffs are clusters of smaller muscles, tendons, etc, and attach to various parts of the body. If the tendons are torn and/or ruptured it can cause back pain. The injuries usually occur when sudden impacts or forces target the region. Exerting the muscles can also cause injury. If the tendons are damaged, it causes inflammation and swelling, which obviously creates pain.",

The bursa can cause problems when the shoulders are suddenly tossed over the head. Treatment for subacromial bursa conditions, include steroid regimens, physical therapy, meds, etc, especially when inflammations sets in. The condition can cause back pain, since bursa is an assistant to the joints, cartilages, bones, and synovium. Bursa works by playing down the risks of joint damage. If bursa inflames it compresses the nerves, or tendons. What happens after is failure, especially once the joints rub. The soft pockets amid the bones that overlap and protect other bones can cause serious back pain, since inflammation has set in from bursa disorders.

            "Once the fibers, nerves, and muscles are affected, it causes direct actions to the tendons and ligaments. Tendons are tough bands that connect to muscles and bones, which these inelastic cords or bands of tough white fibers connect to tissues that attach to the muscles and to the bones as well as other areas of the body. Sinew or tendons join with ligaments, which the two function from collagen. Tendons connect to the muscles, which initiates movement, or contractions that enforce bone movement. In some areas the tendons will connect to the muscles and then to the bones. In this area, tendons will exert a pulling force that causes the bones to respond, by moving. The bones move, yet the tendons will hold the bones securely in position. Tendons provide a measure of stability. At the back, the tendons provide slight exertion, which promotes bending. Tendons will elongate so that you can bend forward, which promotes the action of muscles known as \u201ceccentric contraction.\u201d Once eccentric contractions start, the muscles and tendons join to allow you to continue what you were doing at the start of bending forward. This promotes what doctors call \u201cIsometric contractions.\u201d Sometimes tendons fail, as we grow older to work with the muscles, which in turn causes nerve compression, breakage, or conflict etc, which causes back pain. Now, if the nerve compression, or tendons fail and they rub alongside the soft pocket that is amid the bone, which overlaps and protect other bones, we have problems. (Bursa) Since the tension applied effects the muscles, and it is too weighty for the muscle nerves to withstand, thus the tendons use its sensory nerves to slow down, or hold back the muscles from moving.",
            "Ligaments are tough tissues that connect to various body parts, which these sheets and/or bands of strong fibrous tissues connect bone to the bone and to the cartilages at the joint and /or supporting organs, such as muscles.",
            "Ligaments keep the distance at bay between the bones. Like tendons, you do not want to tear or strain these connective elements, since it can cause inflammatory. In short, we need to balance tendons and ligaments to avoid back pain that comes from injuries.",
            "Tendons make up the skeletal anatomy in some areas and consist of \u201c206 bones,\u201d which are flat, short, long, and sometimes asymmetrical. These tendons combine with bones store narrow (RBC) red blood cells, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. Since experts will recommend Maalox, which has bases of magnesium it can be speculated that this has something to do with pain as well.",
            "Tendons support the muscles, movement, and protect various internal organs. In addition, tendons join with the skeletal muscles, and finally the ligaments. The skeletal muscles support the bodies movement and posture, which these muscles tighten and shorten movement. (Contracting) The skeletal muscles attach to the bones through the tendons and starts muscle contraction from stimulus of fibers from the muscles and via the motor unit or neurons.",
            "Contractions promote energy from ATP (adenosine Triphosphate) and hydrolysis. The energy derives from these two creations and extends to ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and on to phosphate. Once the chemicals and/or substances produce, it moves to retain selective contractions to afford tone of the muscles. In short, balance is achieved, which moves to relax the muscles by breaking down acetylcholine via cholinesterase.",
            "We are now reaching the ligaments. Once we reach the ligament phase, it starts to encircle the joints and adds stability and strength. Now it connects to the tendons, which connect the muscles to the bones. Joints are connected to these elements of the skeletal muscles, which when ROM is interrupted, back pain occurs."

Otherwise, you may find local massage therapists in your area, which offer affordable treatment. If the massage increases your pain, ask the person to stop. You may need medical treatment. You should avoid massages if you have fallen and injured your back, or if you were recently in an accident. Seek medical help first.",
            "You can also relax the back if your muscles are tense. Relaxation promotes wellness, since the muscles can rest from over-exertion.",
            "To avoid complicating common back pains you should move around at least 20 minutes each day. Throughout the day we sit, lie on the back, stand, walk, etc, which all applies gravity pressure to the spine. We can learn proper sitting strategies to avoid complicating common back pain.",

            "Back pain has affected millions of people around the world. Back pain is caused from trauma, injuries, inappropriate bending and lifting, and disease. Back pain is common, yet some people suffering back pain for a few short months, it disappears and is never felt again. Others will feel the pain daily for the course of their lifetime. What causes back pain? First, we must consider the muscles and nerves in back pain, as well as particle muscle diseases to answer the question correctly.",
            "The muscles are where we get our strength to move, since it exerts pressure that forces the bones to move. The muscles are the locomotive mechanisms that are constantly interrupted by the actions we take and the gravity and influence of the weight that affects us from the earth. When we perform asymmetrical actions, the muscles achieve a degree of strength from the spinal column. It supports this structure of the muscles to a degree. On the other hand, the muscles that promote movement, i.e. these systematic structures enable us to lift, pull, walk, swim, stand, etc.",
            "During movement, the muscles will act by contracting. This means the muscles shrink, expend, tighten, and narrow, and so on. Due to the shifting the muscles start to absorb shock, which the muscles will release pressure, or tension. The muscles then control what actions we conduct. We see this when the muscles allow us to sit, walk, etc. In fact, the first thing that hits the ground when we walk is the heel, which is why we experience heel pain at some point of our lives. The bearing weight is placed on the heel, which the muscles react allowing one to drop the remaining foot to the ground, bending the knee to continue movement.",
            "The spinal column assists the muscles in many ways. Yet, the spine is made up of neurons, or nerves, which promote our sensory and motor skills. The motor nerves emerge from the muscles activities. Specifically, these motor nerves are sponsored by the voluntary muscle activities, which promote body motion. The nerves will transmit from the brain and then the spinal cord, impulses that travel to the glands and the muscles. When we move, the action is enforced by the motor nerves.",
            "We also have sensory nerves, which relate to sense organs and sensation. We use sensory nerves to heighten our awareness and to transmit communication to the joints.",
            "The sensory nerves continue sending the messages down to the muscles. Once the message reaches the muscle it travels to the organs and blood vessels, and continues to the skin and finally reaches the cranium. In short, we get our feelings and senses from these nerve signals.",
            "Motor impulses and sensory messages combine to alert the motor unit. The motor unit is made up of fibers that compose the nerves and muscles. The motor unit is also the motor neuron that acts on muscle fibers and nerve fibers.",
            "Back pain includes muscle spasms, which start when one of these fibers cannot act with the other fiber. What happens is the muscles undertake involuntary actions, such as usual tighten of muscle contractions. If the contractions are restrained further, thus it can cause extreme weakness and/or paralysis. Now, if the muscles and fibers are not working correctly, i.e. the muscles are not producing enough contraction, or the muscles are producing too many contractions, thus it causes back pain.",

            "IT depends, but malaise can cause infections that create Osteomyelitis. Malaise is the process where the muscles are compressed or depressed. Osteomyelitis may arise from extreme body temperature, bone pain, increases of pain when moving, localized edema, redness, tachycardia, muscle spasms, and so on. Tachycardia is rapid or excessive heart beating, which the rates exceed \u201c100 beats per minute.\u201d As I mentioned in previous articles, edema can cause back pain as well, which is seen when Tachycardia starts as well.",

The patient is monitored and tested frequently thereafter and is ordered to submit to laboratory tests. Nutritional support is also advised, as well as special wound and skin care.",
            "Doctors will also recommend antibiotics, such as Cipro or Ciprofloxacin. Tylox, or oxycodone, which is an Analgesic, is also recommended. Splints are needed in some instances. The nurse however will use intervention actions to eliminate potential risks, such as bone necrosis, sepsis, and fractures. Fractures are common since the bones are deteriorating.",
            "Sometimes surgery is necessary to treat Osteomyelitis. Surgical interventions are setup however to avoid operations. The interventions include bone grafting, bone segment transferring, incisions, and drainage of abscess bones, and/or sequestrectomy.",

            "Osteoporosis causes back pain, since it affects the joints, lumbar, thoracic, and so on. The common symptoms of Osteoporosis are weakness, joint pain, back pain, height loss, unsteady gait, Kyphosis, or Dowager\u2019s hump, and so on. Osteoporosis affects the metabolic bones, which leads to dysfunction and results in bone mass reduction and increases in porosity. While the thoracic involves the chest, if you read more about edema and related illnesses you can learn how it causes back pain.",
            "What causes Osteoporosis varies. Osteoporosis may emerge from drops in estrogen levels. Estrogen is a hormone that works in harmony with a selection of steroid hormones. The hormone produces in the ovaries, which stimulates sexual heat (estrus) and develops the female secondary sex characteristics. Estrus is the sexual heat we feel as females, which starts at regular intervals when excited.",
            "Lack of exercise, immobility, and deficiency of calcium is also considered when Osteoporosis is present. Protein deficiency, bone marrow disease, deficiency of Vitamin D, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, Hyperthyroidism, liver disease, and increases in phosphate is all linked to Osteoporosis.",
            "When Osteoporosis is present the bones rate often exceeds the rate in which the bones form. Osteoporosis causes phosphate (Phosphoric Acid) to increase stimulation, which are affected by the parathyroid activities, and increases in \u201cbone resorption.\u201d",
            "Parathyroid glands are located near the thyroids, which is where parathyroid activities start to increase when Osteoporosis is present. Osteoporosis also causes estrogen to slow bone resorption. Bone resorption is the process where the bones resorb or uses other mechanics to resorb or partially fuse fluids, chemicals, etc, which emerge from hormones, such as estrogen. When the fusions are partially acting it performs actions, yet when the action is interrupted, it causes responses, in turn causing change in conditions, such as pressure or temperature.",
            "The actions behind Osteoporosis cause back pain, joint pain, weakness, and so on. Doctors will often order X-rays and photon absorptiometry tests to discover Osteoporosis. The tests help the doctor see thinning of the porous bones, or increases in the curves of the spine. In addition, mineral drops are noted within the tests when Osteoporosis is present as well.",
            "Once the doctor diagnosis the patient with Osteoporosis, he/she orders medical treatment and nurse interventions. Management includes supplements, which are commonly Vitamins D, C, Calcium, specifically Calcium Carbonates-Os-Cal. Estrace or Estradiol is added also, which is estrogen supplements. The patient is recommended to join in activities, only when tolerated. To treat the pain, doctors often prescribe NAID-based prescriptions, such as Dolobid, Naprosyn, Naproxen, Motrin, Ibuprofen, Voltaren, and so on.",
            "A diet must be maintained when Osteoporosis is present. In addition, the doctor monitors the musculoskeletal system, since disorders can cause additional interruptions. Doctors will generally monitor the patient\u2019s activities, as well as limit their activities, since Osteoporosis can cause fractures or breakage of bones. The problem will lead to further complications. At this time, there are no surgical interventions to fight Osteoporosis, yet Osteoporosis is common, which experts are diligently searching for cures.",
            "When doctors consider Osteoporosis, they must also weed out Osteogenic Sarcoma, or Osteosarcoma, as well as Gouty arthritis, Osteoarthritis, and related disease. Many of the disease challenge doctors, since their symptoms are similar in comparison.",
            "If you were recently diagnosed with Osteoporosis, you may benefit from correcting the posture and training the body mechanics. Your doctor probably recommended that you do this, otherwise inquire within.",
            "If you were recently diagnosed with Osteoporosis, you may also want to learn more about your disorder at the Osteoporosis Foundation. Learning more about your diagnose can help you to gain control over the disease."

Fractured bones to be precise are broken bones. The bones however are detained and held in tact by surfacing tension, as well as tissues that surround the bone. Fractures occur when the muscles are overexerted.",
            "Many people are at risk of fractures, especially those who overexert the muscles while exercising. Some people strive to loose weight and fit in a bikini, accordingly these people may workout 7 hours in a day, which is overexerting the muscles. What these people fail to realize is that the muscles need rest, and that working out 30 minutes daily will help you loose weight.",
            "Overexerting the muscles is one of the leading causes of fractures. To spot the problems doctors will use X-rays, bone scans, and so on. Fractures can worsen if left unattended. In short, if you injure the area and fail to seek medical assistance, your problem could worsen. While the body has elements that heal through a natural process, nature is interrupted as we age, which leads to slow healing. If you have sustained a fracture, it is wise to avoid workouts that overexert the muscles. It depends on the bones, i.e. if the elongated bones are fractured; you want to avoid overexerting the muscles up to eight weeks at most.",
            "Fractures can affect the muscles. The muscles skeletal structure is made up of elongated threads of fiber. The fibers assist the muscles by supporting contractions and shortening, which joins the ending attachments. Tissue sheaths enclose around the fibers, which shape specific muscles. Within the muscles, blood will smooth out traveling over the muscles, which the blood will then spread out to the fasica and/or epimysium. The blood travels to the bundles of fasciculus, endomysium, nuclei, fibers and cells, etc.",
            "Damage can occur to the muscles and tissues named. Damage includes complete and incomplete tears. Prolific bleeding may occur if the muscles are completely torn. The muscle damage can be treated with R.I.C.E, i.e. bed rest, ice packs, compression packs, and elevation. You will need to visit your doctor as well.",
            "If the muscles are incompletely torn, likely sections of the sheath are interrupted as well. The injury is also treated with bed rest, ice packs, compression packs, and elevation.",
            "Other tears occur in the muscles, which include intramuscular tears. The tear causes squander to enter the muscles, or blood and travel to the tissues. Fluid is restricted. The condition causes tenderness, and pain. Mobility is limited from this condition, which is in medical terms known as \u201cintramuscular haematoma.\u201d",
            "If you are diagnosed with this condition, you will need bed rest, ice packs, compression packs, elevation, yet you should challenge the muscles in a couple of days. In other words, start moving around after you have rested in a couple of days.",
            "Failing to do so will lead to worse conditions. Muscles can reduce contractions, which makes the muscles stiff and scar if movement is not applied. Calcification interchanges with the pannus. The results lead to joint subluxation disorders when calcification does not interchange. Calcification is irregular solidification, which can cause swelling and stiffness of the joints. In some instances, intramuscular haematoma can create calcification. Calcification disorders will deposits of calcium salt to occur, which makes the muscles unchangeable and inflexible. Unfortunately, intramuscular disorders can heal slowly, and sometimes surgery is necessary to correct the condition.",

Rheumatoid arthritis may link to genetic transmissions or autoimmune illnesses according to etiology aspects. Physically speaking Rheumatoid arthritis inflames the synovial membranes, which often affects the pannus. This action causes destruction in the ligaments, bones, and the cartilages. Once the pannus is hit, fibrotic tissues start to replace the pannus. Calcification also replaces the pannus, which results in joint subluxation conditions. Calcification is abnormal hardening, which causes swelling and joint stiffness.",

The patient may experience anorexia (Eating disorder), malaise, fatigue, limited range of motion (ROM), subcutaneous nodules, pain and swollen joints, and rises in body temperature. The joints may also demonstrate mirrored images, which is noted when the symmetrical joints swell. Stiffness in the waking hours often occurs as well, which is followed by \u201cparesthesia of the\u201d feet and hands. Patients also demonstrate signs of crepitus, inflamed lymph nodes, pericarditis, leukopenia, and splenomegaly.",

            "Doctors conduct tests, including x-rays, latex fixation, gamma globulin, synovial fluid analysis, and hematology tests. If the tests show positive results, such as spacing between narrow joints, erosion of bones, platelet, WBC, ESR increases, IgM and IgG increases, decrease of opaque and viscosity, and rheumatoid, thus a diagnostic is set.",
            "Once the diagnostics are concluded management, interventions, stress reduction, etc are incorporated to treat the patient.",
            "Management often leads to heat/cold therapy, gold therapy, etc. Gold therapy is used to intervene with infections reaching the inner central of the muscle layers, thus averting them from reaching the wall of the heart. The joints are often extended when and kept in form. Skin care, emotional care, etc are also prescribed.",

Express your feelings, otherwise suppression will only increase your symptoms, as well as pain. In addition, you want to learn to live in a calm environment, as well as provide comprehensive care for your feet and skin. Make it a daily habit. If the condition worsens, you may have to endure surgical procedures, such as synovectomy and/or joint replacement.",

The sacrum connects to the hipbone and forms into the pelvis joining the lower region and iliac bones. The iliac bones are larger structures that connect to joints called sacroiliac. The sacroiliac is a fraction of the hip ilium and the joints sandwiched between the sacrum and the ilium.",

Sacroiliac joints can only move a unit of length equal to one thousandth of a single meter, since the joints are thicker than other joints. The sacroiliac joints give support to the arms, shoulders, trunk, and cranium in all directions. Amazing, since the joints sit low and near the pelvis and sacrum:",
            "The joints often move in direction of the other and provide less mobility than any other joint or muscles that makes up the spine. The forces of gravity that restrain these joints increases the odds of back pain, since these joints will experience overloads of tension caused from the strain that emerges from larger lifts of the lower back and the trunk along the contractions of the upper back region. The joints are restrained also by a group of the most compelling muscles in our body, which these muscles curve over the sacroiliac. Still, the sacroiliac is our support for the cranium, which we can move in all directions because of these joints. As well, the sacroiliac controls the movement of our arms, shoulders, and trunk.",

This area makes up a small number of bones at the larger spine and sets it self apart from other elements of the back. Beneath these bones are disks. In addition, intricate tissues that connect the bones lay beneath the lumbar giving us support, since it surrounds various parts of the body and organs that consist chiefly of collagen and elastic. The connective tissues also support reticular fibers, cartilages, fatty tissues, etc. The connective tissues however do not have blood vessels or nerves that connect.",
            "At the back are two separate spinal columns that are flanked between the disks. The spinal columns loosely fit between the surfaces of joining parts. In summary, four surfaces join slackly to corresponding spinal columns. The two columns will move smoothly, sliding transversely over the other surface. You can notice these vertebras in action while considering arch aerobics, or similar movements. The lumbar joins with spines at the curvature of the back.",
            "Now, these areas of the spine allow us to twist, turn, move from one side to the other, and bend back or forward. The ribs do not underpin these areas, since it is higher than the lumber. This means that injuries are likely to occur from actions, such as twisting. In fact, the lumbar is holding up more weight than the average bones and joints in the vertebrae, since it must withstand over volumes of stress.",

            "Back pain sometimes merges from muscle spasms. Spasms largely start when one or the other nerve or muscle fibers cannot act with the other fiber. What takes place is the muscles assume involuntary reactions, such as atypical tightening of muscle. The action causes the muscles to restrain its contractions. If muscle contractions are reserved by the fibers, nerves, etc, restrained additionally, accordingly the lack of contractions can cause excessive feebleness and/or paralysis. If the muscles and the nerve fibers are not joining correctly to perform action, i.e. the muscle fibers are not yielding suffice contractions, or else the muscles are creating too much contractions, consequently the result causes back pain.",
            "Muscle spasms increase back pain, since potential threats are apparent to the muscles. Since the sensory nerves are not providing the nerve fibers at the muscles, the sustenance it needs to contract correctly. The problem can lead to damage of the muscles, since the muscles, which are lacking strength stretches, thus contracting over the fibers. The sensory nerves are failing to send signals to the muscles, and other areas that require support from the sensory nerves, which leads to back pain.",
            "Such action can cause spasms, as well as nervous tension, joint misalignment, and sprains. Muscle spasms can start when the muscles are fatigue, or else when a person exercises heavily. When the body is dehydrated, it can also cause muscle spasms. In addition, pregnancy, which puts a lot of weight on a person, can lead to muscle spasms. Hypothyroid, deficiency of calcium and magnesium can cause spasms as well. The body has hormones, which promote growth and metabolism production, which if these hormones are not working sufficiently to produce and reproduce the fluids the muscles require, it can affect the metabolic, in turn causes muscle spasms. Excessive drinking, failure of the kidney, and particular medications can cause muscle spasms.",
            "Tip: You can perform chest stretches, groin, hamstring, hip, thigh, and triceps stretches to minimizing potential muscle spasms.",
            "Muscle spasms are often over defined, since cramps produce similar stress and pain as that of muscle spasms. The problem lies between muscle and nerve fibers, muscles, joints, sensory and motor nerves, motor neurons, and so forth. Yet, as outlined earlier, muscle spasms start when the fibers, nerves, unit, etc, and not functioning properly. Still, the problem moves down to the tendons and ligaments, which when these elements of the body are inflamed, or else damaged and pulled out of place, it can cause muscle spasms and damage, in turn causing back pain.",
            "Keep in mind that muscle spasms are abnormal contractions of the muscles that can cause shuddering, twinges, seizures, tremors, and paroxysm. Paroxysm can cause outbursts, convulsions, and so forth, which sometimes when spasms occur, pain is not apparent.",
            "As mentioned, the ligaments and tendons can affect the muscles as well and start back pain. Both ligaments and tendons are strong elements that connect to the bones, joints, and muscles suspiciously. The tendons and ligaments aid the muscles by promoting movement, bending, sitting, walking, standing, etc, yet the prime sources of these actions come from systematic muscles. The muscles give strength, which helps by exerting tension to enforce the movement of the bones. These locomotive promoters once interrupted can cause limited mobility, which in turns starts to damage the joints, cartilages, tendons, ligaments, etc. Since the muscles get a degree of strength from the spinal cord and pain occurs when the systematic muscles are not working properly. The muscle deficiency affects the asymmetrical muscle actions as well.",

Hip joints connect to the pelvis, joining with the elements listed above and with the vertebral column and finally connect to the sacrum. Larger bones join at the legs, which is where we get our support and strength to hold up the vertical column.",

The legs are capable of moving, which additional stress is applied. The stress continues to the lumbar spinal disk. This disk is affected by the stress as well. To give you an example, if you were to pick up a 2000-pound object, you would have the same amount of stress applied if you would have sit down on the couch.",

Now, if you consider the elements spoken of in this article, you may wonder how it can cause back pain. The fact, when pulling up a tight pair of khakis, or trousers it can generate unusual tension. The tension affects the lower and upper back, thus causing pain to arise. The reason behind this is that the higher muscles cannot counterweigh for the pressure group taking place at the lower region.",
            "Back pain can emerge from the advantage we receive from the spinal column as well, such as the control over the body. The spine has a prime focus and that is to give us such control or advantage to stand, walk, run, and sit and so on. Due to this control we have however, if we were to pick up 20 pounds, it would be the same as applying around 200 pounds on the bones, muscles, and the spine.",
            "Now, if you think about what I just said, you would see that as people we often take the spine for granted, yet the granted we take is present in the tendons, muscles, ligaments, etc, and because the stress we apply is greater than the spine can handle, injuries occur.",
            "Sure, we all have to stand, sit, walk, move, and perform daily activities, yet as we do this we are applying stress to the spine, more so than we realize. In short, picking up a single cup of coffee is more weight than you realize.",
            "When one considers the spine, they must also consider weight, depth and the distance end to end. Since the spine is made up of small and large bones, as well as thin and thick bones and joints, the vertebras in all areas exert its own degree of force and set limits on the lower and upper back. . As you can see, the pressure we apply daily to the spine gradually builds and causes lower and upper back pain. We still must consider inappropriate bending however, since twice; the weight is applied when one lifts heavy objects and fails to bend properly."

            "How the cylindrical girdle affects sacroiliac",
            "The intermediary cylindrical girdle is the go-between for the sacroiliac. Since the sacroiliac does not have support, yet it permits a variety of turns and twists, it needs an intermediary to hold it up. The sacroiliac connects with the ilium and sacrum at the upper area of the hipbone or ilium and the joints between the ilium and sacrum. Now, if this girdle is interrupted it can cause a disease known as muscular dystrophy. The disease is crippling. MD is characterized by plodding waste of the skeletal muscles.",
            "The Cylindrical girdle is also known as the pectoral girdle, and/or the shoulder girdle, which is a scheme of bones that support, paired frontal limbs, such as forelegs, arms, or fins. The bones also surround the stomach and gives support to the sacroiliac joints. The Cylindrical girdle helps us to raise the posture, or body keeping it erect while standing.",
            "The cylindrical girdle connects to 12 areas of the back, i.e. 12 spinal columns. Attached to the 12 columns are the thoracic vertebrae. These ribs hold breathing space, leaving a gap within the body to promote breathing through a vacuum-like funnel that inflates into the respiratory organs in the vertebrae\u2019s, or lungs.",
            "The lungs is an air-breathing vertebrae that pairs spongy organs connected to the respiratory and sets within the rib cage, transferring oxygen into the bloodstreams and removing carbon dioxide as it travels. The thoracic vertebrae are a protective shield for the vital organs, as well as the backbone. In addition, the thoracic shields the lungs, liver, and heart.",
            "The thoracic bones is connected to the channel ribs",
            "At the spine is an elongated line of bones that is supported by the ribs. The thoracic ribs levers the bones. Along the channel are several ribs, which erect and extend to the joining front spine. This makes up nine ribs that lack mobility, yet another three ribs below these babies protects the nine and makes room for additional movement. Now we have potential back pain for real, since those joints are subject to wear and tear. Now between all of these medical terms, rest the joints, which often degenerate causing diseases, such as osteoarthritis due to frequent twisting, turning, etc.",
            "We can discuss a brief background of osteoarthritis to help you see where it leads. First, osteoarthritis is a form of arthritis that affects the back, since joints and cartilages gradually lose strength. The disease often hits middle-aged people, yet it could start early. Read the details above to learn why.",
            "In addition, these joints could endure damage from injuries, vehicle accidents, brutal attacks, and so forth.",
            "The joints mentioned enable us to turn side to side and in various directions, which is what causes the wear and tear.",
            "The joints outlined also connect to the cervical spinal column. The cervical spinal column is the neck or cervix that relates or belongs to any sections of the body that bear a resemblance to the d\u00e9colletage. The cervix rests at the d\u00e9colletage, rather the neck of the womb. It consists of a narrow passage that leads to the vagina. The cervical spinal column has around seven spinal columns. Spines start to shrink forming smaller forms as they reach or near the cranium. Attached are near level joints that become wider and slightly incline in the direction of the higher section and to the facade region of the body.",
            "The cervix can move in many directions. In addition, the cervical spine connects with the higher region of the cranium, thus providing support. These areas are of concern, since people often use their head to balance, which is what causes headaches to occur. Once the headaches start, one will often experience pain at the cervical and continues onto the lower region of the back."

            "Outline of the spine:",
            "I believe that outlining the spine can help you see the elements that make up our person, as well as give us the ability to perform daily. The spine at the top includes two vertebras and separates by the cervical vertebrae. Between the joining vertebrae are disks and the associating nerve roots. Down toward the center back is the thoracic vertebrae, which below it is the body of the spine. Joining these elements below is the neuroformen, which is slightly higher than the disk that separates the two spines. Below the disk are the nerve roots and to the other side are the lumbar vertebrae. Below the nerve roots is the facet joints and almost adjacent is the pelvis. Below the joints is the sacrum, which adjacent is the sacroiliac joint. The coccyx sits at the bottom of the second vertebrae and completes the spinal column.",
            "Having an outline of the spine can help one appreciate how the back is structured and to see areas that could lead to back pain.",
            "As we look at the outline, it can help us to appreciate that the spine makes up elements that help us to move, bend, slope, and twist, which each movement can cause back injuries.",
            "Within the structure of the spine, we have separate bones. The total count is \u201c34,\u201d which these bones connect with the spinal unit, facet joints, vertebral body, disks, spinal unit, and the facet joints at the lower section.",
            "The coccyx alone makes up the fuse bones, which is around five or less. The bones rest at the base of the spine. The fuse bones are the tailbone in basic language and disable us, since the limb does not poise the spine. Rather the spine is our balance mechanism. Now, when we loose poise, it could cause falls.",
            "The coccyx is at risk, since it could break and lead to coccygodynia. Coccygodynia is a back condition that causes serious pain.",
            "How the coccyx is broke?",
            "The coccyx can be broke when a car accident occurs. In addition, trauma impacts can break the coccyx, as well as falling backwards.",
            "How can I tell if I have coccygodynia?",
            "A stabbing pain often occurs in the back, which sometimes the pain is sharp. This is a clear indication that potential damage has occurred to the coccyx. If you have difficulty sitting, you may have coccygodynia also. If sitting is difficult, likely you will feel pressure at the right side. Sometimes bowel movement is difficult as well.",
            "What should I do if these symptoms arise?",
            "Ask your doctor to test you, using x-rays. If the x-ray is negative however, you may have only bruised your coccyx.",
            "Additional fused bones climb the steps up the spine, making up another five bones. The sacrum meets in this area, which is a bone as well. The sacrum is a triangular-like bone at the lower back and joins with the hipbone on either side, forming the pelvis. The sacrum connects to the only area of the back limbs at the lower region. At the outer area of the pelvis rests the iliac bones. The larger bones connect to the joints known as sacroiliac. The joints are part of the hip ilium bones and the joints between the sacrum and the ilium.",
            "The joints at this area shape similar to a horses saddle and interfaces the pelvis sides flanking between the pelvis and sacrum. Why are we discussing this area, since it really does not make up the spine? Because, this region is the single common section of the connective parts to the spine, where the lower back pain starts due to asymmetric, and deformity."

            "Inside the skeletal muscles rests some powerful elements, which include ligaments and tendons. The ligaments alone are muscular bands of stringy-like threads that produce collagen threads of muscle fiber. The fibers and threads of ligaments connect to the bones, which attach to the muscles. Collagen is essential, since it exists in the connective proteins found in muscle fibers, skin, tendons, bones, cartilages, connective tissues, etc, which collagen halts the flow of semi-solid proteins, which are transparent and rests beneath the cartilages and bones. (Gelatin)",
            "Ligaments join with the bones and joints, which in areas the fibers and bands of threaded-like elements will surround the joints. We get our strength from this action. Working with the ligaments are tough bands of connecting muscles that join with the bones. The inelastic bands and/or cords of tough fibers that join with the connective tissues and attach to the bones and muscles are known as tendons. Tendons can suffer tearing, which can also scar the muscles. Tendons provide us strength, power, resilience, and so forth.",
            "Tendons join connective proteins, or collagen. The inelastic cords make up fiber proteins. Attached to tendons are joints and cartilages, which feed from the tendons and ligaments. Ligaments form a bond by connecting to the joints. The joints\u2019 connective articulated junctions spread amid the bones. Within the connections, we get our ability to move, as well as our range of motion. (ROM) ROM is the level of joint is ability to move, which if range of motion is restricted; it causes swelling, inflammation, and pain. The back pain emerging from limited ROM can affect the joints, and the membrane known as synovium. This membrane is the joints\u2019 liner and supplies antibodies. Antibodies are produced to ward off infections. The protein is manufactured via B cells, and acts through responses from the body of antigen. In short, if bacteria or virus is present the antibodies will kick in and ward the potential risks off. Now, if the antibodies do not kick in, it can lead to disorders of the synovium. We now have fluids that are not creating properly and are affecting the cartilages. Since the fluids are not responding, as it should, our body starts to avert the need to ward off infections.",
            "Antigen is fluids that stimulate the production of antibodies. Now that we have problems emerging from ROM, etc, we can see that it moves to affect the cartilages. The problems outlined in this article not only cause back pain, but can also cause arthritic symptoms. Arthritic symptoms also cause back pain. Now that Range of Motion is interrupted, the smooth planes of the cartilages start to deteriorate. When deterioration sets up the cartilages will restrict range of motion. Deterioration also causes the cartilages to resist when weight-bearing joints are attempting to act. The cartilages are also sturdy elasticity tissues that form skeletal muscles and bones during the growth cycle. If the cartilages are disturbed, it can cause interruptions of the bursa. Bursa once more is a sac filled with fluid. The fluid in bursa assists the joints, bones, cartilages, synovium, etc, by reducing friction and minimizing risks. Bursa disorders cause swelling, and inflammation.",
            "When bursa conditions are present, the pain will sometimes start at the lower back, and may continue to other areas. Symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, numbness, limited mobility, joint stiffness, fevers, swelling, and so on often emerge from bursa conditions.",
            "In worst conditions muscle spasms, poor posture, skeletal deformity, edema, inflammation, and so on may arise.",

            "5. I've posted here before about the \"more\" tag. You write your post as normal, then decide where you want to break the post up onto a new page. You put the more tag in and readers have to click to a new page to read the rest of the story.",
            "6. Write once per week special projects. These are a series of articles on a particular topic. You will be offering it once per week giving readers a week to comment on it, then have them hanging on for next weeks special post in the series. Each time add links to previous posts in that series.",
            "7. Using your content from your other websites or blogs is also a great way to get more pageviews for all of them. Use the target new tag and refer to material on your other blogs and websites. It will open a new window leaving the current blog open while they visit your other website or blog. You can quickly double up your pageviews while also introducing your readers to your other websites and blogs.",
            "8. Make a list of 10 previous posts and the links to those posts. Make a post in your blog about 10 things you want your readers to know and read in case they have not done so before. At your suggestion they will at least go see if they have read those posts before, increasing your pageviews once again plus bringing old material to new readers. That also lets them know they should browse the archives for things they have missed.",
            "9. Using that same list of 10 posts or a new one, visit other blogs on your topic. Find posts that talk about something similar to one of those 10 posts, then instead of adding a link in your signature to the home page, make a comment there and refer to the post that is similar and that contains helpful information to that blogger and their readers. You will also be increasing your link popularity while doing this. Do not spam the link. Make sure it actually contains useful information. Don\u2019t be trolls or spammers and you will end up with new readers and more page views for your blog.",
            "10. Do not stop being creative. Use the tips in this article, plus invent some of your own ways to interlink your blogposts together. Create pages. Don't just post and forget. That content is valuable, use it. Do not make people search your blog. They are lazy and busy. Bring it to them. That is just good customer service.",
            "I hope this article helps you learn there is more to blogging than just writing a post once in awhile or even daily. If you employ the tips I just gave you into your blog I guarantee you will increase your pageviews which in turn will increase your revenue if using an ad program in your blog."

            "Summary:",
            "This article contains information which details the art of successful blogging.  It explains how blogs can be successful while growing an everlasting experience.",
            "Keywords:",
            "blog, blogs, blogging, free blogs, free blog, make money with blogs, successful blogs, professional blogging, successful blogging",
            "Article Body:",
            "Blogs can be a very marketable and very profitable tool if used correctly. Profiting from blogs is just a matter of grabbing the attention of an audience and not doing any actual salesmen selling. In this article you will learn the 13 most essential steps to successful blogging.",
            "1) Where to start?",
            "You should begin your blog with a free blog hosting service such as Journal Home. I don't say that because I'm the owner, but a free blog host is very rewarding for a new blog.  Starting with a free blog hosting service allows you to begin blogging instantly without having any advance knowledge of scripts, hosting, or programming. It allows you to build an audience and buzz for your blog.  It allows you to focus on your content and not the internal maintenance of the blog. The best benefit of starting with a free service, is in the case your blog doesn't become successful you do not lose any money or are you left holding the bill. The great thing about a blog is that they are organized in chronological order, your latest entry is displayed first. When your blog traffic grows greatly and you are ready to upgrade to your own domain then you can simply make your last blog entry the announcement of your \"move\".  Simply add a last entry stating that your blog has \"moved\" and type the new blog URL address. Which directs visitors to your new blog site, keeping your following, without a major inconvenience to anyone. Upgrade as you need to...but only when you need to!",
            "2) Niche",
            "A niche is a targeted product, service, or topic. You should first decide on a product, service, or topic which interest you. Choose an area which you can enthusiastically write about on a daily basis. You can use keyword research services like Google Zeitgeist or Yahoo! Buzz Index to find popular searched topics. It does NOT matter if your topic is popular as long as there is a audience for your topic and the topic is precisely focused then your blog should be successful. Anything can be considered a niche as long as it has a target audience no matter how large or how small the audience is. A blog about your cat can be a niche or a blog about the species of the cat family can be a larger niche market, if there are people who are interested in hearing about your cat or the species of the cat family, then you have a niche...you can even choose to build your audience for a market which an audience does not exist, but first you must build your blog.",
            "3) Update Daily (nothing less)",
            "This step is a must and not a suggestion. Updating your blog daily not only keeps your blog more interesting to readers, but it also gives your blog fresh content on a day to day making it more appealing to search engines. Not updating your blog on an occasional holiday or one day here and there is understandable to most, but missing days at a time or weeks is unacceptable and will most likely result in your blog being unsuccessful. To keep your blog traffic and retain your visitors interest it is a must to update your blog daily with multiple entries. Though, I am seeing a growing trend of successful blogs that are not being updated daily, but they are successful and have a stable audience who continue to visit their blog daily.  Regardless, these blogs are still updated weekly with multiple entries.  Until you have a steady audience you should try to update your blog everyday with at least 3 or more daily entries. The best way to accomplish this is to set aside 1-2 hours a day for tending to your blog and adding new entries. It may even be wise to schedule a set time which you dedicate to your blog each day. Give yourself work hours and treat your blog as a job, what happens if you don't come to work for days or weeks...you lose money or worse you get fired! Same applies here...if you don't update your blog for days or weeks you'll lose visitors.",
            "4) Traffic",
            "It's no secret. You must have traffic to profit from blogs. There are numerous ways to build traffic. Paid advertising, free advertising, viral marketing, search engine marketing, RSS/XML feeds, and word-of-mouth. You should always use your blog URL address in the signature of your email, forum discussions, message boards, or any other communication media. You should submit your blog URL address to search engines and blog directories. You should submit your RSS/XML URL feed to blog ping services like Technorati, Ping-O-Matic, and Blogdigger. You should confidently share your blog with family, friends, co-workers, associates, and business professionals when it relates. Many blogs can be considered as a collection of articles, for this purpose you should submit your blog entries (those that are valuable and lengthy articles) to content syndicators like GoArticles.com or <a href=\"http://www.zapcontent.com\">ZapContent.com</a>. Once submitted your articles can be picked up and published by others. The trick is to make sure you include your Blog URL address in the \"About the Author\" passage. What this does is create link popularity and backlinks for your blog, when someone picks up your article from the syndication then publish the article on their website the \"About the Author\" passage is included with each publication and the link you included is followed, crawled, and indexed by search engines. Imagine if your article is popular enough or controversial enough to produce 10,000 publications across the web. The search engines is bound to find your blog in no time with that many publications and credit you a authority on the topic, in return increasing your rank on search engines. The small effort of writing a well written article is rewarding. You should try to write at least 1 full length article every week for syndication and submit your article to at least 10 article syndicators.",
            "5) Track Your Blog",
            "How do you know if your blog has traffic? Just because no one is leaving comments doesn't mean your blog isn't growing. Many visitors do not leave comments but they are returning visitors. I know it sounds crazy but with blogs people are more interested in what \"you\" have to say! Many visitors do not comment their 1st, 2nd, or 3rd time. Some do not comment at all, but are active daily visitors.",
            "Tracking your blog does not have to be overly sophisticated usually a simple free page counter like StatCounter.com or Active Meter will do the trick. Install (copy/paste) the code into the html of your blog template and start tracking your visitors. Its better to use a service which gives you advanced traffic analysis, such as keyword tracking information, referral information, and search engine information. Visitors, returning visitors, and unique visitors should be standard for any page counter service you choose.",
            "6) Listen to Your Audience",
            "When using the proper page counter you should begin to see how others are finding your blog and if through search engines then which keywords are being used to find your blog. If constantly your blog is being found by 1 or more keywords then focus your blog around those keywords to make it even more powerful. When writing entry titles and entries use the keywords as often as possible while keeping the blog legible and interesting.",
            "7) Multiple blogs",
            "Use multiple blogging accounts (free) to attract more people. This means you should have a blog with JournalHome.com and others. The more blog accounts the better (be sure to read and adhere to the Terms of Service for each site). You can copy/paste from 1 blog to all others. Having different blog accounts is like having a publication in different newspapers. This enables you to attract more visitors and this also increases the chance that 1 of your blogs will be in the search engine results for your focused keywords.",
            "8) Short & Concise",
            "Aside from the lengthy article a week for syndication and publication your blog entries should be short & concise (if you can help it). Sometimes there are exceptions to the rule and you have no choice but to blog lengthy entries, but try to avoid this as much as possible. You do not want your blog entries to become hours of reading. Visitors like to easily find information and skim through your entries. It is good to be detailed and provide useful information, but do not include useless information or run away sentences that veer away from your topic.  Stay keyword-focused.",
            "9) Digital Art",
            "Try to include non-advertising graphics, pictures, photos, and art in your blog entries. Not too much. Once a week is fine. Graphics can sometimes bring your blog to life. Of course, the content of the blog is the most important aspect and you do not want to overshadow your content with graphics, but displaying graphics can add a bit of spice to the blog. Be choosy about your graphics and make sure they fit your entry topic. You should add content with the graphic, at least a caption. Original graphics, photos, pictures, and art is recommended.",
            "10) Keep it Personal",
            "A blog is most successful when it is kept personal. Try to include personal experiences which relates to the topic of your blog entry. Stay away from the business style of writing. Write with a more personal style and use first-person narratives. Do not write any of your entries as sales letters, instead share product reviews and personal endeavors.",
            "11) Interact With Your Visitors",
            "You now have the traffic you deserve. You should begin interacting with your visitors. Create a regular theme such as: \"Monday Money Tip\" or \"Picture of the Week\" which entices your readers to look forward to each week.",
            "Give your readers advance notice about a product, service, or topic which you are going to review and then talk about later. If the President was scheduled to give a speech then in your blog you should state that you \"will discuss the speech and give your opinion after the speech airs. Comments will be appreciated\".",
            "Try your best to find exclusive information that not many have. Do not disclose any confidential or secret information which is deemed illegal or can potentially get you into trouble, but try to get the scoop before everyone else does. Such as: If your blog was about Paris Hilton (the socialite) and you had a blog entry about \"Paris Hilton Getting Married\" then it would be interesting to your readers if you had a actual picture of Paris Hilton engagement ring. Give your best effort to dig and search the internet for exclusive information and you will possibly come up with something useful. Your readers will appreciate this and they show their appreciation through word-of-mouth referrals. Imagine how many readers will tell their friends, family, and others about information they only can find at your blog.",
            "12) Make Money",
            "Once your blog has gained some real momentum and your blog traffic is increasing then it is time to start thinking about turning your traffic into profit. You should use contextual advertising, like Google Adsense or Chitika. Contextual advertising is usually text links which use the content of your blog to publish targeted ads on your blog. The payout is usually based on a pay-per-click model, meaning for ever click an ad receives you are paid a small percentage of the profits. In addition to contextual advertising it is good to also use graphical advertising such as: BlogAds.com, Amazon.com, MammaMedia, or General Sponsored Advertising.",
            "13) You're a Professional",
            "You're a professional now! What are you still doing with that free blog hosting service? It is time to upgrade to a domain hosted solution. You need to get a web host and choose a domain name for your blog then check its availability. Select the blogging software you wish to use, such as: Squarespace.com, WordPress.org, MovableType.org, TypePad, etc. When you have your new blog domain setup and ready for traffic then it is time for you to announce your move on all your previous blog accounts. Your last entry to the blog should be a \"move\" announcement. The title should be \"Moved\" and the blog entry should state something like \"I have a new home for my blog, please bookmark and follow the link: http://www.YourNewBlogDomainName.com\". This way all returning visitors and new readers should not have any problem finding your new blog domain.  Plus, search engines can easily index and crawl your new blog, since your old blog should already be popular with the search engines.",
            "At the level of a professional blogger you may want to team up with 1 or more other bloggers. This will create a more interesting and more powerful blog. The old saying \"two heads is better than one\", more authors mean more advertising and exposure because each author will have a vested interest in the blog. The idea of a team blog is to make it profitable and rewarding for all authors, while continuing to target the blog topic and keeping the blog interesting for visitors.",
            "Following these blogging techniques should make your blogging experience much more rewarding. There is no guarantee that your blog will become popular or a household name, but the effort should at least put you one step closer. Making money online is not an overnight experience like many may think, but making money online is definitely a foreseeable possibility. As well, growing popularity on the web is not an overnight experience, but through time, dedication, and persistence you will be rewarded with all the royalties of blogging.",

            "1.) Create at least four keyword posts per day.

            "3.) Submit to Google's Reader. When you submit your own blog RSS to Google's Reader the Google Blog Search will index your site.",
            "4.) Add a relevant link directory to your blog and trade links like a demon possessed! Although it may take more time than simply submitting to a search engine one time, this method is perhaps the best way to drive traffic to your site. Use software such as Zeus to speed up the link trading process.",
            "5.) Use ping sites like ping-o-matic. Ping your site every time you add a new post.",
            "6.) Submit your blog to traditional search engines such as AltaVista, and MSN.",
            "7.) Submit your blog to traditional directories such as DMOZ. Directories (particularly DMOZ) increase relevance with Google. DMOZ is very picky, but what do you have to lose by trying?",
            "8.) Submit to as many RSS Directories and Search Engines as possible. This is a simple but repetitive process that can be done with software such as RSS SUBMIT.",
            "9.) Comment on other blogs. Do not just leave short, lazy comments like \"I agree.\" Leave well thought out replies that will force readers to wonder \"who wrote this?\"",
            "10.) Use track backs. If there is a blog that you refer to or quote and it is highly relevant to your subject, leave a track back. It increases your link popularity and may even score a few interested readers from the linked site.",
            "11.) Go offline. Use newspaper ads, public bulletin boards, business cards, even stickers to let as many people as possible know your blog exists.",
            "12.) Ad a link to your blog in your e-mail signature block.",
            "13.) Use Groups (Usenet). Find a relevant group on Google groups, Yahoo groups, MSN groups or any of the thousands of other FREE group services and find like minded people and talk with them. Make sure your use your blog URL like it is your name.",
            "14.) Use Forums. Forums are one of the best places to go for advice. Go to forums and find problems to solve. Make sure you leave your blog name, but be tactful about it; some forums get annoyed with those who selfishly drop a few links to their own site and leave.",
            "15.) Tag your website. Tagging is a new idea that has erupted across the web. Sites like http://Del.icio.us, Technorati and many others have a social feature that allows you to place your article under keywords or \"tags\" that everyone interested in that tag can see.",

Imagine getting paid to write about subjects that interest you, whenever you want, wherever you are! The flexibility involved allows you to maintain your blog at your own pace, and with Internet caf\u00e9s easily accessible all over the globe, even your vacation won't get in the way of your blogging... Or should I say: even your blogging won't get in the way of your vacation?",
            "In this article, let's take a look at the profitability of a blog and set up one of our own, free of charge! Interested? Read on!",
            "First, you need to get yourself a blog. There are several options \u2013 host a blog on your own domain or get a free one. For starters, let\u2019s talk about the free blogs. You can obtain one at http://www.blogger.com or the newer (and better!) http://www.wordpress.com. WordPress is a free blog engine that is robust and infinitely expandable.",
            "Blogger is actually owned by Google, so it will be detected by Google\u2019s radar faster and you will be indexed more quickly. WordPress.com, however, is a relatively new option so I have no comparison on the speed of getting indexed by search engines. However, WordPress is better in the sense that it has more advanced features such as Trackbacks and Categories. You can also manage your sidebar links more efficiently (more about this later).",
            "Get a free blog at either Blogger or WordPress. Then, familiarize yourself by publishing your first post on your blog and tinkering around with the options and templates.",
            "Here are some words to start expanding your blogging vocabulary:",
            "Permalink \u2013 Permalink stands for permanent link, which is a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that leads to an individual post that you make in your blog.",
            "Trackback \u2013 When you post about someone else\u2019s blog post elsewhere, your post will show up in their \u201ctrackback\u201d section. This feature, however, is not available with a Blogger account.",
            "Pinging \u2013 Blogging seems to be paired with pinging almost every time either one is mentioned nowadays. Pinging is actually the action where a certain aggregator is notified whenever your blog is updated, so that the aggregator may show the newest post of your blog on their website. This is a useful way to gain traffic, which I'll discuss in a future article.",
            "Content",
            "Next, let's look at the type of content that's suitable for your blog in order to make it profitable. You need to understand that there is no fixed scope that your blog should have, which means you can write about whatever you\u2019re interested in. Mind you, the difference between a profitable blog and a non-profitable one is the way you write. What would you prefer: reading your university professor\u2019s lecture notes or the latest novel by your favorite author? People prefer to read \"light\" items most of the time. When they check out your blog, they are not only looking for information, but they are also looking for information that they can access easily.",
            "So, to attract more visitors as well as to keep your current readers coming back for more, it's very important to add a personal touch to your blog posts. This can be done by simply imagining that you\u2019re talking with your personal friend. An extra bonus for your readers would be a great sense of humor, so try to add funny comments in your articles where relevant.",
            "Another important point is to avoid addressing your reader as a plural unit. Don't write as if you\u2019re preparing a speech. Instead, write as if you\u2019re having a conversation with a single person, an equal friend, because this will make your reader relate to you more easily.",
            "Besides that, it's also very useful to establish your own personality through your words. We're very curious creatures, so naturally your visitors would want to know as much about you as the information you\u2019re offering them.",
            "Having a distinctive personality in your blog will make a world of difference between your blog about gadgets and all the other blogs about gadgets out there. This is a lot like creating your own brand name, where people immediately remember your blog\u2019s name when they need information about gadgets, just like how people immediately think of McDonald\u2019s for fastfood or Nike for sportswear.",

When you find the blogs pertaining to this marketing group, post useful and intelligent information about topics that pertain to your company. You might not want to sound like an advertisement. Think about responding to another comment and simply tagging your signature with your company\u2019s website. This is a subtle way to get their attention.

It reaches a targeted marketing group and lets them know your company\u2019s name, products, and sometimes offers an endorsement. Overall, it is an effective way to get your business out there. When people have no idea who you are, they are not going to feel comfortable working with you. The better your reputation is, the more likely they will trust you. When you have no reputation at all, they will not trust you either. So, even if you just want to use blogging to build your company\u2019s reputation, it will be worth your while. Give it a try and see what type of results you can get using these tips."

Some blog writers even updated several times a day. Readers will tend to loose interest in your writing if they have to wait several days for new material. Be loyal to your readers and your readers will be loyal to your blog. Also, there are literally thousands of blogs available on the Internet. If your blog is not updated on a regular basis, you will loose your readers to another blog site. Another fun way to update your blog and keep your readers interested in your site is to include something fun for your readers to enjoy.

In addition, you can gain new readers when doing this. You can also be loyal to the blogs of other writers and ask them to visit your site. Leave nice comments about their site and invite them to your site. If you have mutual interests and the same type of readers, you can even share your blog links on your site. This helps everyone. Your reader will appreciate interesting reading while you benefit from readers from the other site.",
            "Understand who reads your blogs: Another great way to keep blog readers coming back for more is to understand who reads your blog and write content that is directed towards them. This does not mean that you have to write on only one particular subject, though. If you are a stay at home mom and write about your life at home with the kids, your loyal readers may not appreciate it if you write about cutting edge topics or use a lot of foul language in your writing. If you generally write humor, do not bog your readers down with sorrowful woes and tales. Your readers will be interested in the things that attracted them to your site in the first place. That is usually what you are more interested in writing about. You can gain a better understanding of your readers interested by including places for comments and encouraging your readers to contact you by email.",
            "Include keywords: You can gain readership and help keep your current readers by including certain keywords in your blog. If you have entered your blog on a search engine, these keywords that point to your blog will come up after a search. This is a great way to get readers interested in your blog. This is also a good way for companies to increase the traffic to their blog.",

This is a common problem that almost always revolves around a small list of common mistakes made by the blogger. A blogger can sit back and expect the blog to do all of the work for him or her, which is a terrible way to approach blogging. A successful blogger would tell you that great blogging takes a certain amount of dedication and hard effort to make it work. You have to put effort into a blog to sustain it, especially after the first month or so of completing the design. Many people work so hard during the initial design phase that they get lazy after it is complete. To avoid this happening to your blog, check out these five common mistakes that can bury a blog.",
            "Infrequent Updates",
            "One of the biggest mistakes a blogger can make is to \u201cforget\u201d about posting. The most successful blogs are updated with new posts at least once a day. Some larger blogs are constantly being updated. You should try to create new posts as often as possible. If you miss a day here and there, it will be no big deal. However, if you miss a week or more without posting, you might as well consider the blog dead already. You have to take a few moments, even as few as five, a day to create interesting posts or content. If you are writing short and concise posts like you should be, this should not be that challenging. It is easy to keep your blog updated, if you make it a priority.",
            "Too Much Advertising",
            "Most bloggers today do want to make a profit from their blog. This is a trend that can get out of control quickly however. If you are interested in adding ads to your blog, do so with caution. There is nothing wrong with a few appropriately places ads that offer viewers links to places that correlate with your blog\u2019s content. However, adding a massive amount of advertisements on your blog is a mistake. If you have a bunch of flashy ads on your blog, your content will get lost within the hoopla. Therefore, you should always limit your ads to three or less per page. Make sure you place them in appropriate places that let your content shine through. Don\u2019t allow enormous ads to fill up your pages either. They will simply annoy readers. Be smart about including advertising on your blog!",
            "Unprofessional Look",
            "Looks do matter when it comes to your blog. The more professional and crisp your blog looks, the more your readers will take you seriously. If you are interesting in boosting traffic, you should try a more serious layout or presentation for your blog. If you can afford to hire a professional, you should. If you choose to do it yourself however, you must make sure the end product is good. If you have a sloppy blog that looks \u201chomemade\u201d you will not likely have a great response. Try different layouts and approaches to see what gets you the most traffic.",
            "Graphics Overload",
            "Pictures can add a ton to your blog and draw in more readers. However, when done excessively, much like ads, pictures can drive people away. The main reason too many pictures can ruin a blog is because there are many web surfers who still use slow internet connections. When they try to load your page, it will take an excessively long time to do so. This in turn will likely drive them and anyone else with this problem away. Try limiting to a few pictures per page.",
            "Inappropriate Content",
            "Everyone knows that the web is a place where you can freely express yourself. However, if you want your blog to survive, you might want to think about that freedom of expression. Although you should always say what you feel, you can do so in appropriate manners on your blog. There are ways to say anything on your mind, without using profanity or any offensive lingo. If you want your blog to be successful, you cannot be inappropriate with your content."

            "Blogging is a concept that started in late 90s. It used to be a way to comment an existing webpage, an opportunity for visitors and readers to react or voice out one\u2019s opinion on the said page. What started as a single-sentence commentary has evolved into pages of personal take on just about anything and everything under the sun. As it continues to move forward, online advertising has tapped into the blog\u2019s potential. Here are 5 reasons why you should use blogging as an Internet marketing tool.",
            "1.Blogging is simple. The simplest way to get your piece on the net is through blogging. No skills are necessary\u2026 an average adult can read and type, or at least click a mouse. It\u2019s like having a virtual piece of paper and you just write your ideas, experiences, new products, and hope that the truth behind your articles comes out and entice your reader to also try your product. If you have a PC and an Internet connection (who doesn\u2019t?) then you can blog and advertise.",
            "2. Blogging is authentic. In this day and age where advertising saturate our lives, we question the credibility of promoters\u2019 claims. However, in blogs, real people share their real-life experiences, unscathed by paid advertising. Reading blogs about first-hand product use is like talking to people about their first-hand experience. You definitely want to buy a tried and tested product.",
            "3. Blogging is free. Because blogging is yet to be proven as a mainstream online advertising media, most sites see it as something to augment current marketing tools and thus offer it for free. Any opportunity for free webtime is definitely a bonus especially to businesses that are starting up. Needless to say, paid blog pages can generate more income for your seriously growing business.",
            "4. Blogging builds credibility. As you get more and more into writing your experiences on a particular product or industry, your readers come to realize that they can depend on your posts for their own information needs. As such, you become an expert on it; as a consequence, more readers visit your site and more bloggers link to your blogs. As companies and professional organizations notice the growth of your readership base, they may soon get in touch with you for advertising on your blog page, or make you an affiliate, which pays for every referral generated from your blog site.",
            "5. Blogging builds your market. Unless you are a Hollywood star, chances are, only your Mom reads your posts. Mom has a lot of friends, so she lets her friends know how interesting your blog site is. But you need not depend on Mom to increase your readership base. Look into the following ways to build your market through blogging:",

In this age of speed and quick access, logging in and downloading e-mail is simply taking longer than clicking into a blog site. Let them explore your site by using a short e-mail message as teaser to your blog site. If your e-mail is on an entirely different subject, use your e-mail signature to give a link to the site.",
            "-By using subscription. An easy way to get your readers e-mail is to give them an opportunity to subscribe to your blogsite. Keep some exclusive information for your subscribers to entice readers to subscribe and give their e-mail address. Just be responsible in using their e-mail address, as the last thing you want is a comment on your blog that you are a spammer.",
            "-By understanding your readers. Conduct a simple survey for your readers to understand their profile and advertising preferences. Ask consumers to give you feedback on a post, an ad link, or a trial that you shared. In this way, it is like interviewing your readers without the commitment and intrusion of a face-to-face interview.",
            "-By joining a blog network \u2013A network of blogs maybe a collection of blog sites that share the same industry, interest, readership base, payment mode, etc. Consumers find credibility and convenience in clicking one link to several real bloggers about a single subject.

Some celebrity is sure to be in trouble again; have anything to say about that? Maybe you have an idea about who should be dating or marrying who. Who died? A nice memorial post for a nice person may be in order. What happened \u201cOn This Date\u201d in past years? Some past events are worth researching and writing about. Are you into sports?

You might have a different perspective on the latest hot topic that might just be interesting to your fellow bloggers or a perspective that might make them mad (BTW, never worry about making bloggers mad -- most of them love having something to gripe about). If you can't find anything that inspires you in your favorite blog, surf through some of those blogs that always make you mad; the ones that seem to promote everything that goes against your lifestyle. Anger is always a good blog motivator but don't get so angry you get irrational. Comment on some blog posts and then expand your comments into a post on your blog. Also try logging onto Blog Explosion, Blog Clicker or one of the many other blog traffic generator programs -- there are lots of ideas out there that are worth writing about from either a pro or con perspective.",

Write about your latest read -- recommend it, blast it or even write an abstract for your blog (but don't give away ending). How about movies, the great ones or the pitiful losers might be worth some good or bad words -- you could make movie or book reviews regular features of your blog. The same goes for television shows. Start a series that follows your favorite TV show, there might be quite a few fans of the same show that will be interested in your take and appreciate your summary of episodes they missed. If there is a book, movie or TV show that you thought was great there is sure to be a reviewer who panned it. Find the bad review and write a post countering the reviewer's opinions.",
            "What have you been doing? Your work place, your co-workers, you bosses, your home and your family members are all fair game for your blog -- keep it short and amusing and you'll have a great post. Once you introduce a particularly interesting person to your readers you may want to do some sequels.

If you can make something that is unique or something that is common but made special because of what you know, there may be people interested in knowing how to do it. Give away tips on cooking, sewing, cleaning, fix-it projects, pet care, child care, beauty secrets, personal care or organizing tips. Make it a regular feature on you blog.

The best bloggers do put themselves out there via their posts. They will post what\u2019s on their mind and their views or opinions on pressing issues. They may do so in a humorous manner or be quite serious. Sometimes new bloggers are afraid to post their true thoughts because their blog can be commented upon. The fact is however that not everyone will agree with your thoughts and posts, but you should not let that hold you back. These are people who don\u2019t personally know you, so their comments really don\u2019t matter much anyway. Don\u2019t be afraid to let your true feelings show on your blog, after all, that it what an online journal is all about.",

For example, including your phone number or address in a post or on your profile is probably not a good idea. You should think smart and only allow people to know things that you want them to know. For your own safety, you might not want to post your last name either. When someone has a lot of information about you, it is easier for them to victimize you through identity theft, harassment, or other crimes. So, stay safe and never post really private information.",

First, never use their real names. This is a huge mistake. Unless the person gives you permission to write about them, you should never do so. It will only lead to trouble. If the person you mention reads your blog, they could get offended that you are writing about them. Even if the post is positive, it can be seen much like talking behind their back. Try to keep the posts about you or celebrities or other public figures. Let everyone else\u2019s business remain their own.",

Post on different topics so your audience can stay interested. Also, post at least twice a week. People who will become fans of your site will want to read as much as possible on your blog.

By using similar topics, you can skip all of the hard research work and still be a success. Never use their ideas exactly, just take them and use them to develop your own. For instance, if there is a major political issue going on in the news, consider creating a post about what you think about it. You don\u2019t have to use the news story, just the topic idea along with your own words.",

Don\u2019t steal their ideas, but use the visit to stir up great ideas of your own. Sometimes when you see others working at their highest potential it can spark new potential in yourself. You can see which topics get the best response for their blog and decide if you could get the same response with a similar topic.",

            "Blogs are a very popular ways of promoting your product or service. They are easy to install, easy to administer and easy to update. And search engines love them too. But what is a blog without traffic?Exactly. Here are five quick ways to boost traffic to your blog and start seeing those big sales.",
            "1.Build a list of blog services to ping",
            "There are a lot of blog services you can ping. This means that you notify this service, that you've updated your blog. These services then list your new posts and you get the traffic from them. I've made a list of 50+ blog services you can ping on my site. These list are also available if you search google or any other search engine for it. That should be enough to give an initial boost to your traffic.",
            "2.Add buttons to popular news readers",
            "What does this mean? Well there are sites like yahoo or google or bloglines etc, which have a members area where you can select sites with RSS feeds to fetch the latest updates from different blogs. That way you can have the latest updates from let's say 50 blogs listed on one page. I have a list of these popular pages on my website plus the buttons which link to them. Users can then easily add my blog to their news reader members area.",
            "3.Update your content regulary",
            "Search engines and blog services love regular updates. It's very likely that you will get targeted traffic from search engines if you post regulary. That means you should make a new post to your blog at least once per day. But be careful. Too many updates per day can harm your search engines position and hits. What's too many? 10 or more.",
            "4.Post in forums",
            "Post in forums, but don't spam them. Post something fresh and interesting and put a link to your blog in your signature. Don't just post in any forum. For example if you're selling cds, post in forums that are about music and cds. Don't post in car forums if you're selling furniture. By posting in forums you will get one-way links which are good for search engine position in search engines like google or msn or yahoo.",
            "5.Submit to blog search engines",
            "There are masses of search engines available, that list only blogs. Just google for \u201eblog search engines\u201c and you should find at least 20 of them. These blog search engines will help you with targeted traffic. Be sure to write a good title and a good description to your blog, so that people will easily find it and click on your link.",
            "Follow these 5 steps and you will start seeing lots of traffic to your blog. And the so long awaited sales will start coming in. And don't forget to update your blog with fresh unused content that you write yourself."

Some advertisers are offering money for blogs that get high traffic amounts, so learning to blog better can be an important task. If you are interesting in learning more about better blogging, check out these six helpful tips.",
            "Use a Casual Tone",
            "The most interesting blogs are not written using formal grammar rules. Frankly, the formal tone can be a little boring and web surfers don\u2019t want to read through a bunch of \u201choity-toity\u201d text. If you want your blog to be popular and a success overall, consider writing in a more casual tone. Think of the writing as being a conversation you are having with a friend. Write exactly the way you would talk, not the way you are supposed to talk. Using slang and other words that may not be considered \u201cproper\u201d is a great way for your blog to reach a wide variety of viewers. Using humor and other personality characteristics in your writing will make people want to keep coming back to read your newest entries.",
            "Don\u2019t Overdo It",
            "Keeping your blog short will help you retain any interested viewers. People don\u2019t want to spend massive amounts of time reading text on the web. If they wanted to read a novel, they would do just that. Try to stick to your point and keep it nice and short. A blog that is more than 500 or 700 words is just too much. If you need to carry on with the topic, consider creating another post that finishes your point. Although this is basically creating one long blog, the break in the text will be welcoming and readers will be less likely to get bored.",
            "Never Advertise Improperly",
            "Too often people use blogs as a space to advertise their services or their products. This can be a cheap way to get your work out there. It is noted however that blog readers can get annoyed quickly at advertisements on blogs. If you must advertise on your blog, consider doing so in a more subtle manner. Write a short post about your product and put a link to your website. Don\u2019t take up your entire blog space with the advertisement. Although it may seem like a great idea, you will essentially be scaring people away from your blog altogether.",
            "Check Your Spelling",
            "Although the tone of your blog should be kept casual, you should still edit your work. There is a way to be casual, without being sloppy. You should always check your spelling before you submit your post. If your posts are sloppy and full of misspelled words, people will think that you are not educated and probably won\u2019t take anything you say seriously. Some blogging software comes will a spell check features, while some doesn\u2019t. If your blogging software does not come with any spell check feature, simply create your post in a word processing software and use the spell check there. Then cut and paste your edited work into the blogging software text area. This will allow you to post without spelling errors, which is highly recommended.",
            "Be Versatile",
            "If you want to reach the largest amount of people, you do not need to advertise endlessly. You simply must be versatile with your post topics. Those blogs that cover only one type of thing may be popular with one specific targeted group of people. That is fine, if it is what you want. If you want to reach everyone however, you need to post on everything. Consider posting on current affairs, music, books, and other hot issues. This will draw people in. When you post about popular things in the news, it will draw people to your site when they do a search on the web.",
            "Post Often",
            "People who become fans of your blog will likely be looking for a new post every few days. Some will only look once a week. If you want to keep your blog fresh and interesting, you should post often. Posting often is something that takes very little time, because your entries should stay short and sweet. It is a way however to keep things new and exciting for your biggest fans. They will be waiting for your new posts and will continue logging on as long as you provide them with new information."

            "Gather Ideas",
            "The most difficult part about writing anything is deciding what you want to write about. Blogs are interesting because you can use them in several ways. You can use them as a personal online journal of sorts if you wish. You can also use them as a place to post your opinions and views. Lastly, you can use them as a place to put short articles of interest for others to read.",
            "If you are choosing to use your blog as a journal, you might not need much planning. You will probably simply want to begin writing and see where it takes you. If you want to use the blog for your opinions or for articles however, you will need to gather ideas. Create a list of topic ideas that interest you. Use them to determine what your topic will be. After choosing a topic, make a quick outline of main points you want to include. This step may seem tedious, but it will make the other steps go much more quickly, so be sure not to skip it.",
            "Choose a Tone",
            "After you have chosen your topic and created your short outline, you will need to choose your tone. The most successful blogs are written in a casual tone, which is a welcoming idea to most non-professional writers. Don\u2019t worry about grammatical rules. Simply choose a tone that is like the one you would use when speaking with your spouse or a great friend. The tone should be friendly and stress-free.",
            "Write Your Post",
            "When you sit down to write your post, remember the tone you chose for your piece. Keeping the tone in mind put your topic idea and outline in front of you and begin writing. You should keep your blogs posts pretty short. They should contain your main point within the first sentence or two. Don\u2019t ramble on and on or you will risk losing your reader somewhere in the middle. You can strive to keep your posts between 300 and 700 words altogether. This may sound like a lot, but once you start writing, you will see that it will not take a lot of time to get to this point. Don\u2019t forget to write in a casual tone. Write exactly like you would speak. Avoid large words that some people may stumble over. Create interesting, yet simple posts for everyone to enjoy.",
            "Use a Signature Ending",
            "A signature ending is important for any blogger. You can choose to end each post with a specific quote or phrase. You can add your name to the bottom with a special symbol nearby. It really does not matter how you choose to end your post. Be sure to choose a signature ending however. A signature ending is a great way for regular readers to see that your post is ending. It can be a comforting sight for many readers as well and make your blog seem more personal.",
            "Edit Your Work",
            "After all of the writing is said and done, you should always edit your work. Editing is not always a fun thing to do, but if you want your blog to be taken seriously, you should go back over your work. Look for misspelled words and other common mistakes. Although you are not worrying about grammar, you should not misspell words. When you are certain your text is mistake-free, you can move on to the last step.",
            "Submit Your Update",
            "The final step to creating a blog post is to submit it to your blog. This is typically done via the blogging software. There is a spot where you can paste your text and click on the \u201csubmit\u201d button. The software should do the rest. After submitting, visit your blog as a reader and check out your new update."

            "We are still very much in the infancy stage of the internet, that being said, everyday thousands of people surf  the internet for the first time. That fact alone is astounding.  It almost seems hard to believe that there are millions and millions of people that have never surfed the web or even checked their e-mail.   That means, the obvious things that most people know about computers, is not known by everyone.  I clearly remember when someone took the time to show me how to cut and paste, now I have cut and paste keys on my keyboard",

            "People spend good money to send you e-mail.  We all know spam is a bad thing and as technology advances its days are truly numbered.  The email that we subscribe to by requesting info, or by purchasing something should be welcome .  Take the time to read their offer, you were interested at some point in what they had to say.  If you are no longer interested, unsubscribe from their mailing list.  Don't waste your time (or theirs) if you are not interested any longer.",
            "3.  Respond to e-mail and blog post as soon as possible.",

            "5.  Don't forward e-mail with your whole mailing list on it.",
            "When you receive those e-mails from someone with the jokes or inspirational stories, before you pass it on, copy and paste it in a new e-mail, so you are not sending all the e-mail addresses that are attached all over the internet.  If that is to much work, don't forward it at all.",
            "6.  Check out offers",
            "If an e-mail gets passed all your anti-spam software, read it.  It is well documented that there are millions of bogus offers on the net, but there are also millions of legitimate ways to make money on the net.

            "I have come up with 7 reasons why every business should have a blog and RSS feed.",
            "1. Publishing a regularly updated blog helps you keep in touch with your existing audience and/or customer base. You can publish updates, news, or thoughts in your blog as well as answer questions.",
            "2. A blog can help you attract new customers. Your blog entries (posts or articles) will become fodder for the search engines and will attract new visitors. If your blog answers the visitors question or attracts their interest you have just found another qualified lead.",
            "3. Blogs and RSS feeds often rank higher in search engines than traditional web sites. Search engines love blogs and RSS feeds. If you design your blog properly then every time you update it the search engines are notified. Even if you don't regularly ping most search engines will revisit blogs more frequently. Plus the very organization of a blog lends itself to spidering and good search engine ranking.",
            "4. Blogs can help you establish or build your reputation in a particular field. As your blog grows you will demonstrate your knowledge in your chosen niche.",
            "5. Blogs and RSS feeds are good revenue streams. You can add pay-per-click ads, affiliate ads, or sell ad space on your blogs. In fact, many PPC companies also provide the ability to add PPC to your RSS feeds.",
            "6. Blogs are great ways to generate leads. Even if you don't want to put any advertising on your blog you can use it to promote or capture leads for your own programs. These are great leads as the fact that they came from your blog means they are already interested in your topic and predisposed to your individual message.",
            "7. Creating your own blog is the easiest way to establish a presence on the Internet and creating an RSS feed is even easier. In fact, it is also the cheapest way to get started on the Internet as there are a number of free blogging sites out there. I started out with http://blogger.com and usually recommend them but have heard others point to several other top blogging sites as well. The blogging software that I now use is WordPress and also happens to be free. In fact, most web hosts now offer WordPress (or other free blogging software) as a free site add-on through Fantastico. Installing WordPress from scratch is quick and easy but Fantastico makes it even easier. Blogs created at Blogger have an RSS feed created for them and WordPress also creates feeds in several variations automatically.",
            "As you can see there are several benefits to starting your own blog and RSS feed. If you can count that many benefits from an Internet marketing technique that is also free and easy then you are foolish not to begin using it for yourself."

If your readers know that you post fresh content every day, they will probably come every day to read it. If they know you post on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, that's when they will come.",
            "2. Stay on Topic.",
            "Stick to your niche. If your blog doesn't have a niche, give it one. Readers like blog's that are focused on a particular theme or topic. If you have no theme and just post about anything, then readers are less likely to become passionate about your blog and will probably move on to somewhere else.",

            "If you help people find the key pages within your blog, their visit will be a much more enjoyable experience.",
            "7. Avoid Not Posting for Extended Periods.",
            "If someone visits your blog and discovers that the last post was three weeks ago, they will probably be disappointed. If you don't post, people may give you the benefit of the doubt and come back on a few days to check, but you better believe they will lose interest quickly if you fall out of your regular schedule and stop posting.",

The old song, \u201cAnything you can do, I can do better,\u201d comes to mind.",
            "2. Ask readers to comment on your blog. In fact, each time you post something, ask them a question. Then spell it out to them on how to post a comment because your readers will probably need to be educated or at least encouraged to comment. (\"Click on the comment link in the footer of this post, and leave your responses.\")",
            "Sometimes readers will need assurances of privacy, in which case, you can ask them to email you their questions or comments in private.

Far from being a scientifically validated study that would pass muster in universities with academicians, an informal survey can give you ideas and material to write about. It can also confirm that you are addressing the concerns of your readers.",

If you want to use these readers\u2019 responses for content in your book, you should tell them. Many people jump at the chance to be included in a book. Others may prefer to participate anonymously.

This is a great way to go deeper into the problems and solutions you are writing about. You can record the sessions, transcribe the dialogue, convert the teleseminar to audio and PDF files. These can be sold, or given away as marketing materials for your book.",

            "7. Consistently reconnect with your passion, and ignite and inspire others with similar interests. After you\u2019ve been blogging for awhile, you will probably develop good blogging habits:",
            "a. Write something on your blog daily, or at least 2-3 times a week.",
            "b. Read other blogs 2-3 times a week. Be sure to use the My Yahoo or other RSS feed buttons to subscribe to your favorite blogs, or sign up to get email updates through a FeedBlitz service on each blog.",
            "c. Write with your readers in mind. And if you\u2019re not sure where their interests lie, ask them. If they\u2019ve found your blog, and have subscribed, chances are you share a lot in common.",
            "d. If you ever fall into blog-block, reconnect with your core purpose for the blog (remember, the one you wrote out before starting your blog?). When this happens there is usually a reason, although it may not be clear to you at the time. This will pass. You can help it along by asking questions \u2013 of your readers, yourself, your closest allies.",
            "8. Podcasting \u2013 Create audio files easily by scheduling teleclasses and recording them. Some people like to get their information auditorily and at their convenience by downloading mp3 files to their iPods.",
            "Use a free teleconferencing bridge line like http://www.freeconference.com to host a call. Record your call, upload the audio file and then post to your blog or podcast using a service like http://www.audioblog.com.",
            "As an added benefit, you can get these calls transcribed; then convert the word doc to a PDF file which you can either give away, or sell, in exchange for people\u2019s email address; http://www.CastingWords.com is a fast, affordable transcription service."

            "Trackback is a system used to associate posts on different blogs and, in a greater sense, it allows blogs to \u201cshare\u201d readers.",
            "An example! Just as a simple example of how Trackback works: If you have just posted an article discussing Admiral Byrd's second Antarctic expedition and then happen to run across a similar or related post on another blog, you could use the trackback mechanism to notify the other poster of the existence of your post. When your trackback notification (which is the permalink to your post and, possibly, some basic information about your blog) appears on the post in the other blog that blog's readers will also be notified that you have something to say on the subject and they may pay you a visit.",
            "Everyone can have it but not everyone does! Some blogs have this Trackback capability built in and others do not but the good news is that Haloscan, a very popular comment tracking program, now offers a trackback feature for those who don't have it and the better news is its FREE! If you are interested you can go to http://www.haloscan.com/members/join.php to sign up. Note that signing up for Trackback (if you don't already have it) will give YOU a trackback capability but you will still not be able to Trackback to a post on a blog that does not have Trackback.",
            "Trackbacks vs. comments! Normally you will see a post you have something to say about and comment on it. Using a Trackback when you don't have an honestly related post -- one that adds something relevant or clarifies the subject post -- is not an accepted practice. If you become known as a \u201ctrackback spammer\u201d by sending unrelated trackbacks you may be banned from the offended blogs.",
            "How it works! Trackback works by sending a \u201cping\u201d (an electronic notification) from your blog to another blog to notify them of your post. This ping also notifies their Trackback program to list your post. Some bloggers moderate their trackbacks, i.e., they manually review each trackback notification and verify that it is indeed a related post -- this prevents spammers from relating their junk posts to real blogs. If the blogger reviews your post and finds it relevant he or she can permit the trackback and your post will then be listed as a trackback on the other blog.",
            "The first step in creating a trackback is getting the \u201cTrackback URL\u201d from the post where you want to send your Trackback notification. If the post does not have a Trackback URL, they either don't have a Trackback capability or they have it turned off.",
            "Next, copy that URL into the appropriate place on your blog's post. This will usually be identified by some reference to \u201cTrackback URLs\u201c or \u201dTrackback pings.\u201d",
            "Next, republish your blog -- your trackback software will automatically send the Trackback ping to the target blog's post.",
            "That's all here is to it, your trackback, featuring a permalink to your post, will be sent to the target post and, after being approved (if the blogger is moderating trackbacks) your Trackback will be listed.",
            "Other functions! On some systems it is possible to send simultaneous Trackbacks to more than one target posts. Another capability of Trackback allows you to send a trackback ping to yourself, linking a post on another blog -- this lets your readers know that the other post is out there and can be considered a \u201crecommended reading\u201d type function.",
            "Just a review of four important Trackback points!",
            "Not every blogger has a Trackback capability and some that have it do not have it enabled.",
            "Some bloggers moderate their trackbacks to avoid unrelated posts being linked. Some however do not moderate or even monitor their Trackbacks, so trackback spammers can sneak in. Don't be a Trackback spammer and don't tolerate them.",
            "Haloscan is now offering Trackback capability packaged with their commenting program (both are free).",
            "Installing Trackback on your blog will not allow you to send Trackbacks to blogs without that capability.",
            "More information on Trackbacks! Wikipedia has a very comprehensive entry on Trackbacks you can find it at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback. Wikipedia articles are always comprehensive and will provide you with information you can rely on."

For me, personally, it sounds like a worded drudgery the way cereals can be soggy, skies can be foggy, and the way minds can be groggy.  But for now, it\u2019s too late to rename this shortened word for web-logging.  Widespread blogging is nevertheless one of the most engaging Internet developments of the past few years.  As a medium it gives rise to many new and worthy voices and plays a new and vital force in shaping opinions, political realities, trends, and even our language.",
            "I believe that a blog is simply a tool to use for someone who\u2019s got something to say.  Let me be clear in saying that a blog is a poor choice for someone who needs a megaphone to scream out to cyberspace in order to elicit a meaningful response from Internet users. If you want attention and want it now and expect blogging to bring it to you, then this will surely be a disappointment.  However, if you like to write and engage others on subjects of which you have some command or experience, then it\u2019s a wonderful application with which you can interact with people who share similar interests as you.  The hype is well founded.",
            "Anyway, here\u2019s a list of blogging tips\u2026",
            "1.) Be topical.",
            "Cohesiveness in message is not optional.  Readers may or may not be interested in your topic, but if your message is haphazard that few will bother remembering to return to your blog because it essentially would offer nothing to remember.  This doesn\u2019t mean blogs can\u2019t jump from subject to subject.  For instance, a blog with a humorous focus has all the leeway in the world for subject matter, but it would be foolish for such a blog to turn the humor on and off.  In such an example, the aspect of humor would be content\u2019s glue, the strength of the blog.  The beauty of staying on point and on topic is that eventually, due to the nature of the Internet, you will find those interested solely in your topic.  (as opposed to online diaries.  There are millions of them on the internet, few have any readers.  Email me with examples if I\u2019m wrong and I\u2019ll be able to show you why you\u2019re showing me a blog and not a diary.)",
            "2.) Refresh your content",
            "Create a schedule and stick to it. Realizing that blogging requires time and effort, don't create unrealistic expectations and be unable to deliver. An occasional lapse or holiday is generally understood but readers returning to find stale, out-dated content are going to find another blog with similar content. New blogs and RSS feeds are popping up on a daily basis. If you have worked hard to develop an audience and a community you don't want to lose them due to lack of communication.",
            "And remember, what\u2019s old is not new and, for blogs, thusly not interesting.  2006 isn\u2019t the time to rail against Enron or Vanilla Ice.  Insight doesn\u2019t matter much to yesterday\u2019s news.",
            "3.) Clear Language Counts.",
            "Blessed is the blog with a clear line of logic.  Write without inside jokes, clique-y catchphrases or ambiguous logic.  First time readers need to be close to your message.  They are more likely to return to blogs that strike them positively.  If the first read is confusing there will not be a second read.",
            "4.) Feed the Spiders.",
            "Search engines take notice of active blogs and blog search engines are especially sensitive to activity.  If nothing else, search engines are smarter today than they were yesterday and are only getting smarter.  In constantly improving they are seeking to aggregate quality; quality blogs are updated several times a week, if not daily, as opposed to once or twice a month.  I don\u2019t mean to scare you but a big spider is watching, so dance for them.",
            "5.) RSS.",
            "Think of RSS like a magic to blogging world, because that\u2019s the effect it\u2019s had.   RSS feeds are a way to exponentially sound your voice to the interested.  These feeds are a great means to increase the distribution and readership of your original content.",
            "6.) Spell check.",
            "Hey man, use the spell-check.  I do \u2013 if I didn\u2019t you probably wouldn\u2019t have made it to #6.  It only takes a minute and can save you from looking like a hack.",
            "Your weblog audiences will be small at first.  And, frankly, that\u2019s the way it should be.  Who are you to think that half the internet will flock to you after three or four posts of your blog, anyway?",
            "If you tough it out while maintaining quality, readership will materialize.  You will link to good, relevant blogs and, in turn, they will to you.  While your voice may be unique, your niche likely isn\u2019t and if your content is emitted smartly to the Internet those relevant readers will respond through readership and interaction.  That I guarantee.",

Let\u2019s see in the next few paragraphs how blogging is used for increasing adsense profits.",
            "You should use only niche blog sites that tend to generate more revenue through adsense. You may choose a niche site where sufficient number of advertisements is available to post. In case of items that don\u2019t sell for a high price and so it is not viable to advertise on the sites as the advertisement costs are particularly high. You can use keyword tools like overture to find out the most common keywords and also how much is paid per keyword. The key here is to get your site ranked well on the search engines.",
            "It should be very much remembered that if the advertisements are more related to the website\u2019s content then your site has better chances of making it to the top of the search engines. You can also place the Adsense code in your website template to make maintenance of your websites easier. Along with blogging you can also choose use channels which will tell you which sites of yours are making more money in comparison to other sites. You should at least wait for a week after you post your advertisement on the website to see its effectiveness. You can configure web traffic from week to week to see which ad format works the best for you.",
            "Another very effective thing to do is to integrate advertisements into the website. You can include the advertisement without any border so that the advertisement can be found by Google easily. You should post not more than 3 advertisements on each web page. You should be able to serve the most expensive ads at all times. You should also never make your advertisements scrollable. You will never see any scrollable advertisements on any website. The highest paid advertisements are normally posted on hotspots.",
            "Along with blogging you can paste advertisements of the following sizes like 336 x 280 rectangle, the 300 x250 rectangle and the 160 x 600. Depending on the type of web browser and website the advertisements may appear in different sizes. You should experiment and track the results for each website.",
            "Hence we see that blogging along with adsense works best for making your website more searchable by people and increase your revenues in the end. Blogging is used to post one way links to your website. You can use softwares like BlogSolution that can automatically post more than thousands of one way links to websites. You can also save your list of links to be used again in the future."

            "Similar to article marketing, posting daily blogs with the keywords of your business included can have remarkable effects on the ranking of your site in any given search engine, and thus net you more traffic. One key to gaining more traffic from keywords is to use \u2018niche\u2019 keywords. These are keywords or keyword phrases that may be searched for less often, but that have less competition. This means you may be able to rank much higher for these keyword. An example: The keyword term \u201cbaseball\u201d is certainly searched for often, but there are millions of websites optimized around this keyword. However a keyword phrase like \u201cAtlanta Braves pitcher John Smoltz news\u201d would have fewer competitors. The longer keyword also increases the likelihood that your blog contains exactly what the visitor is looking for.",

There are top keyword placers that use blogs to retain huge amounts of daily traffic to their sites just by integrating a variety of niche keywords into their posts. The amazing thing about blogs is they are often picked up by the search engines almost as quickly as one posts to it, which makes it an even more powerful tool for SEO purposes.  Our experience has been that blogs that take advantage of Google's Blogger or Wordpress are quickly indexed.",
            "Another way blogging can help your site\u2019s search engine ranking is by the quality score. Most search engines, including Google rank sites with a quality score, the more unique, user provided content, the higher it appears the quality score becomes. If a website is just a sales page, and a few pictures, the quality score will most likely be low. But if a site has a blog on it, with fresh, daily posts, the quality score becomes much better, and thus the site gets ranked much higher when people are searching for your niche, or keyword terms.",

            "Since making a living as a blogger all boils down to trying to get more traffic to your site so they might click on the ads, content is very important. The best thing to do is cover a wide variety of topics. Posting a large amount of short articles on your blog is a great way to get people to your blog. The more keyword rich your content is (saturated with specific keywords), the more traffic you will have. The idea is that when someone goes to a search engine and types in a keyword, your site will come up since you have an article rich with that keyword.",
            "Obviously you cannot have an article on everything. You can however do research to see what the most popular keywords are at the time and try to use them to help you along. Using the time of year is a great thing to. Christmas keywords are extremely popular right after Thanksgiving occurs, so keep important holidays in mind when thinking of keyword phrases to use in your articles. If you are not a great writer, you can even hire freelance writers to help you with the content. The more content you have, the better off you will likely be.",
            "Although this may seem simple, it can be quite difficult really to get people to your blog. There are studies that show different success rates based on the most minor things, like where the advertising box is located on your blog. Some experts will say the left side of your screen is the best place for it, while others will argue that the top is the best place. You really have to do your research and stay on top of the game in order to make a living as a blogger. Simply signing in and creating a post each day is not going to be enough to draw enough people in to make a difference. Since programs don\u2019t pay a large amount per click, you need to get more and more people to click on the ads in order to make any cash at this venture.",
            "But, you can feel great knowing that there is a possibility you can make a little cash blogging. Basically, the more time you put into the blog and researching the advertising programs, the better off you are going to be. While AdSense is probably one of the best places to begin, there are many other programs out there that you can utilize. Just do a search on the topic and you will have a handful from which to choose. After everything gets rolling, you will be happy to know it doesn\u2019t take as much work down the road as the initial setup requires. Soon you could sit back and watch the money roll in without doing much at all!"

Each time one of your readers clicks on an ad on your blog, you earn a small amount of money (a predetermined amount). A slightly different approach is used by companies such as CrispADS (http://www.crispads.com/).

If you have a blog that is dedicated to a particular topic, e.g., digital cameras, that is published on a regular basis, that has a good readership and is recognized as an authoritative source for digital camera information, your blog may draw the interest of a corporate sponsor and you may be approached to run their advertisements for new products on a long-term basis.

            "As your readership increases you may feel the urge to create a blog forum -- a tagboard services, which enables your readers to interact, as if in, a forum. If you are on blogger.com they have several free tagboards that you can use -- look under \"Third Party Add-ons\", or do your own search in Google.",

            "Will there be and misuses with advertising in blogs? Yes. People have different agendas, priorities and scruples.",
            "You will probably see article misuse as well as, reader frustration to advertising if it is overkill.  Thus, first and foremost, the blog must give potential readers quality content, and as to advertising -- it must be appropriate without overkill, or your reader will just simply click the blog away.",
            "For example:",
            "1. If you have more advertising then content -- you've lost the premise of a blog.",
            "2. And if you put links to your own products within the body copy of another person's article, this, in my opinion, is changing copy, and saying that the author endorses the product. (article misuse)",
            "Blogging can be a positive addition to your website or even to your first attempt to gaining a presence online. But with everything, there is a right way and a wrong way of presenting your product, service or views on line.  Remember, to always keep your reader in the forefront -- by asking yourself -- if I was reading a blog, what would I want to see -- and most importantly, what would annoy me the most.",
            "To conclude, blogging is beginning to grow, and its uses, are only limited by an individual's imagination, and of course, the search engines rules -- and I might say, individual readers tolerances and your ethics."

            "I'm not sure what they think blogs are for, but they seem to think they have a noble purpose in life and that they alone decide what is a \"genuine blog\" or not.",

Then wait for your visitors to click the ads. Even if you don't know much of HTML codes, you can benefit from displaying text ads. Blogger offers you to put Adsense ads on your blog's template, and you can do this from the Blogger menu with a few clicks, so no need to bother with HTML codes. It even offers you to match the color of ads with the colors of your blog's layout. It is called blending and it increases click through rates enormously.",

This solution should be an affiliate product or service, that you promote. Most people use the internet to find information for solving a problem. For example, treatments for acne problems, solutions for money matters, where to rent a car on holidays, reliable softwares against viruses and spams, etc. This is where you can wirte about how you had the same problem and how this or that product solved it.",

Your fist post should be lesson 1, the second post should be lesson 2, and so on. Place affiliate links into your posts. You can also use these blogs for generating Adsense revenue. Keep the number of lessons between 10-20. If you don't like writing or don't know the subject well enough, go to free article directories. Pick 10-20 articles of your subject area and convert them into a series. That's all.",

            "I only entered the blogosphere in late 2005 after realizing that I was missing out on an important part of the whole \u201conline communication\u201d genre. As I had been busy managing forums, web sites, and writing articles, I soon realized that I could firm up my two niches \u2013 aviation and article writing \u2013 by blogging on these topics regularly. With that in mind, I soon launched a pair of blogs and I am very happy with my decision. I selected Word Press as I believe that they offer one of the best blogging communities out there. Are you a blogger? If not, why not?",
            "My decision to go with Word Press and not with one of the other big blogging entities such as Blogger, had everything to do with my having complete control over the site. Since I host with Powweb, I discovered that my web hosting company offers over thirty different software downloads for its members. Word Press and a few other blogging entities are represented, but I selected Word Press due to the recommendation of a friend.",
            "Within two or three minutes of my download, I had Word Press up and running. In less than thirty minutes, I had the layout I wanted, although I kept the traditional template in place as I knew I wanted to work on my content first and on the design later. Next, I updated the links on my two related sites to reflect a \u201cBlog\u201d tab. In addition, I picked a few places within each site to announce the new blogs and I emailed everyone on my members list to inform them of my entrance into the world of blogs.",
            "If you select Word Press as your blogging platform, you will soon discover that Version 2.0 was recently released. Because I am new to blogging, I haven\u2019t yet updated from my downloaded version, 1.5. I want to first make certain that Word Press has worked out any kinks that may be in the updated version. In addition, not all the plug-ins you can use [there are plenty of them] with 1.5 are compatible with 2.0 just yet. Most are, but some still are not.",
            "Beyond the update issues, I enjoy using the administrative \u201cdashboard\u201d which allows me to create each blog. Because I include pictures with one of my blogs, Jet Movements, I also have to make certain that the HTML I use to put each picture in its place [alignment] is exact. Word Press allows for you to do that.",
            "In addition, I like the fact that Word Press allows administrators to schedule their entries. You can blog today, but schedule your submission to appear online at an appointed time several days away. Since much of my writing inspiration comes in bunches, I often will tackle several days worth of entries at once and spread them out over the coming week. If I want to later change the timing of an entry or squeeze in a separate one, I can do that too.",
            "Word Press is current with today\u2019s web standards and looks much cleaner and professional than some of its competitors. You can change the template over to one that is in the Word Press arsenal or design a template yourself and upload it to your site instead.",
            "Yes, Word Press is designed to be set up through your own web host, but if you do not have a web site, you can get a free account through Web Press and they will host it for you.",
            "Although Word Press is an \u201copen source\u201d community, meaning it is derived from and driven by volunteers, they have an active forum and many helpful links to assist you with building and maintaining your own blog.",
            "Obviously, I am a very satisfied Word Press customer. You can be  a satisfied blogger too whether you select Word Press through your web host or host your blog directly with them."

            "Article Body:",
            "Building an acceptable use policy for blogging can be one of the tougher jobs for a company\u2019s human resources and internal security divisions to develop. Blogging is a rapidly growing mode of communication that provides readers with material on everything from the day-to-day comments of authors, movie stars, characters on soap operas to hard-hitting news articles and columns. The growth of blogging has given rise to a multitude of programs and tools designed to help everyone from the personal blogger to corporate users.",
            "But how does blogging affect an organization\u2019s Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP)? In order to address blogging accurately in an AUP, you must first define what constitutes a blog.  The word \u201cblog\u201d is actually a shortened version of \u201cweb log\u201d and is similar to a message board in that one can post thoughts and opinions to be read by others.  A blog can be viewed by the public or accessible only via password depending on how the owners have set it up.  Blogs can provide in-depth information about specific topics or they can be a place for writers to vent their feelings, but their ultimate goal is to bring readers together and then encourage interaction among them.",
            "Blogging can be a harmless and interesting way to communicate with like-minded others but, like any unmanaged activity, the opportunity for abuse is always there. If an organization\u2019s AUP addresses their Instant Messaging, Peer-to-Peer, email and other Web-based communications, they need to consider blogging as an important technology to include. Organizations should decide of they want their employees to be able to read blogs or post to them as part of an overall communications policy.",
            "What are the ramifications of no AUP where blogs are concerned? The rapid growth rate of blogs in the country means that entire services like MyFamily.com and MyPlace.com are hosting communities of bloggers. A criminal utilized personal data posted in some blogs to stalk and attack young high-school girls.",
            "Employees that post their identities and information to a response on a blog can influence decisions. For example, if an employee of a major computer corporation responded to a technical blog with advice about avoiding a new product line because of a lot of known \u2018bugs\u2019 the company is leaving itself open to legal exposure. Corporations require employees to sign non-disclosure agreements for a reason, the threat of exposure where company confidential information and intellectual property is concerned could have devastating financial consequences.",
            "This is only one example, there are many others.  If a person severely disagrees with the content of a blog and starts what is known as a \u2018flame\u2019 war with the blogger through the comments section, the corporation may be held liable for the harassment if the employee is posting the responses through the corporation\u2019s computers. What happens on company computers, whether permissible or not, is the responsibility of the company. They are considered legally culpable.",
            "There are legal and financial reasons to be very clear in the AUP with regards to blogging. Some corporations, although only a small percentage, employ software that screens where and how an employee can browse the web. If there are filters preventing an employee from viewing a pornographic website, then there can be filters that prevent the viewing of political or day trading blogs. Blogs that focus on financial and business issues are growing more popular every day. These blogs may be a source of entertainment and information, but it is up to the corporation to decide the level of involvement that an employee may have.",
            "It\u2019s worth mentioning that anonymous guests can read most blogs, although they may not be able to post comments or responses. Blogs can be enormous resources for students, educators and other individuals for discussion, debate and the sharing of experiences. However, they need to be controlled and monitored.  Blogs are an excellent marketing tool, hooking visitors into the site by providing them with financial advice or credit building tips, for example. The marketing a blog can provide can translate into tens of thousands of hits a day for a site. It\u2019s also important for some companies to get their message out there; blogs can put a human face on a company that seems only to be a corporate entity. That human face can improve customer relations, invite consumer contact and increase company visibility.  However, employees should be educated about the type of information they are allowed to post if they are allowed to respond.",
            "Companies that maintain their own blogs should be particularly attuned to the commentary they generate. Blogging is a new frontier for the corporate world, but as with many prior innovations, they are quickly taking advantage of it.  Security, awareness and education will help corporations, employees and even their families from suffering negative experiences while blogging, reading blogs or responding to a blog on the Internet."

Odds are that you have noticed it unless you have been living in a cave for the last four years.  But even with that kind of familiarity of the word, few can say exactly what a blog is.",
            "To understand the blog, first of all a little history is in order.  The word \u201cblog\u201d is short for the word \u201cweblog\u201d.   A weblog is a word coined early in the internet age to designate a journal or diary type page mainly consisting of personal thoughts and reflections.  Most of the time it is updated frequently and can range in topic from the mundane to the profound.  Sound familiar? It should.  What it really is when you get rid of the hype is the good old fashioned diary which has been with us almost as long as language itself.",
            "How long have \u201cblogs\u201d been with us? Well, one of the first instances could easily be ascribed to a work called \u201cKakheperresenb's Complaint\u201d, written by none other than the egyptian scribe Kakheperresenb himself.  (Please don\u2019t try to pronounce the name.  You WILL get a headache.  We will call him \u201cK\u201d from this point forward.) \u201cK\u201d made one of the first recordable blog entries in history circa 2000 BC.  Of course \u201cK\u201d didn\u2019t have the resources and technology we did today and his audience was probably limited considering the fact that most of the population was illiterate.",
            "\u201cK\u201d left with us the memorable phrase, \u201c'Would I had phrases that are not known, utterances that are strange, in new language that has not been used, free from repetition, not an utterance which men of old have spoken.''  Obviously even then people with a blog were STILL trying to figure out what to write!",
            "But no seriously, the blog IS the way to reach fame and fortune and make a little money on the side.  Just ask Darren Rowse, whose most recent (August 2005) income total from Adsense was a little over $16,000!  Yeah, that WAS three zeroes behind that 6.  Not bad for a guy writing his own comments and ramblings about everything from sports shoes to bad movies.   Of course Darren went so far as to even take a course in college on \u201cEntrepeunerial Blogging\u201d.  Needless to say he must have paid attention.",
            "But you need not take a course to have a good blog that generates hits.  Blogger extroidinairre Chris Wright started his by simply posting job openings for engineers which he came across during his own job search.  Word got around and before long he realized his hit count was going up and up and up\u2026 You get the picture.  If you write something interesting that people need to know they WILL come to you \u2013 invited or not.  As Chris\u2019s own story perfectly illustrates.",
            "So run this by me again, you say? You mean ALL I have to do is just start writing stuff about \u2013 NOTHING?",
            "No, not exactly.  As always, in the internet world and in the real world, content is king.  Your writing must be somehow funnier, sharper, wittier, smarter, more bizzare or just plain weird in order for people to link to you and as a result drive up the hits to your blog and hence fatten your pocketbook.",
            "But notice how many options you have.  You don\u2019t have to depend on your education.  Nor do you need a rich and lavish lifestyle that you can blog about while others read with envy.  If you can make the boring, dreary life of the average nobody funny and interesting people will come regardless.  As mentioned earlier \u2013 CONTENT is king.",

We must be careful, though, not to abuse our power through thoughtless acts that hurt the credibility of bloggers and blogging. One place that continues to be our Achilles heel is when good posts go bad.",
            "In the United States, libel and slander are the two categories of defamation. In many states, courts have begun treating them the same as the only difference between the two is that libel is a false written statement about a person, place or thing that harms his/her/its reputation while slander is the verbal act of the same offense. Whether blogged on the internet or whispered offline to your mother, the common denominator is that what is said is false.",
            "Since I\u2019m psychic, I already know what you are thinking. \u2018The First Amendment of the US Constitution protects me. As long as it is the truth, I can say whatever I want.\u2019 Well, sort of. As crazy as it sounds, truth is not the silver bullet defense for every case of libel or slander. A judge may require that besides being true the information relayed is in the public interest to know.",
            "So reporting that the CEO of a major corporation had been caught pilfering money from the employees\u2019 retirement fund would probably get dismissed from civil court whereas telling the world that your neighbor has smelly feet could get you into more trouble than you want. Even if it were true, why would it be in the public interest to know that your neighbor\u2019s feet could clear out Yankee Stadium?",
            "Now, the First Amendment does protect your right to an opinion. If you think that the Mr. Squiggly Toddler Toy is a piece of crap, you are certainly free to tell anyone within earshot as long as you make it clear that it is your opinion on the subject. Likewise, if a person puts forth a negative sentiment with regards to their experience with you and it is clear to any reasonable person that it is their opinion, your legal recourse against them is severely limited.",
            "Parody and satire are also protected. If they weren\u2019t, Saturday Night Live and South Park would have never made it past the first episode. And criticism of a public performance such as a symphony, a play and even a book is protected under the Fair Criticism and Comment clause.",
            "Now the internet contributes some interesting layers of complication to the whole blogging shebang. Instead of being contained in a localized area, libel has the potential to cross international borders and not every country handles these cases the same. One of the major problems courts around the world are having to deal with is the one of jurisdiction. If I live in the US and I libel someone who lives in the UK where exactly does the case take place and who\u2019s laws do we go by? Several cases have set a scary precedent that leans towards being able to sue anywhere around the world for libel published on the internet.",
            "Then there is the issue of third party liability. Say you are a responsible blogger who is careful about her posts to avoid a troublesome libel accusation. One of your readers posts a libelous statement on your blog. Can you be held responsible for that person\u2019s actions? Well, so far the law has only made provisions for internet service providers stating that they cannot be held responsible for how their customers use their services (as it pertains to defamation). Likewise, blog service providers such as Google and Six Apart would likely be immune to any lawsuits arising out of a person\u2019s use of the service.",
            "Whether or not you would be held responsible may come down to if you moderate your comments. If you allow comments to be posted automatically, you may be protected under Section 230 of the US Code (for US Citizens). It may be a different story, however, if you approve comments before posting them. It could be argued that your posting of the comments equates your agreement to them. To date, no one has shown up in court to argue this, hence the fact that we are kind of forced to make it up as we go along.",
            "Defamation is a tricky issue and one that needs to be tread carefully if one is to avoid landing in court. Here are a few tips to help keep you out of trouble. Note: I am not an attorney. I don\u2019t even get to play one on television. If you and your blog deal with some highly controversial issues or you\u2019re just not sure how much trouble you would get into if you published that post about your best friend\u2019s boyfriend, I recommend getting in touch with a lawyer to get the best advice.",
            "1. Change the names. By far the easiest thing you can do is to change or to avoid using the name of the person you are talking about and to strip away as much identifying information as possible. If a reasonable person can visit your hometown and quickly identify the \u201cmealy-mouth cow\u201d you blogged about online, you might want to do some editing.",
            "2. Make use of a disclaimer. Kevin S Brady has an excellent one on his website. Even something as basic as \u201cBy making use of this blog site, you agree that the opinions expressed are the property and responsibility of their respective owners\u201d may provide some defense in the event of a lawsuit. (Check with a real attorney please).",

Extreme exaggerations that no reasonable person would believe are not considered defamation because, quite frankly, they are unbelievable. Be careful though, this type of writing takes a certain je sais quoi, and could easily backfire on you. Have a reasonable person proofread your entry to make sure it passes the believability test.",

Something like \u201cI think that Mr. Squiggly Toddler Toy is a piece of crap\u201d or \u201cThat Mr. Squiggly Toddler Toy fell apart after the first use\u201d are safe bets.

            "The methods by which we use to contact each other, especially in internet marketing activities continue to undergo dramatic transformation.  In the not to distant past (only a couple of years ago!) we kept in touch with customers \u2013 existing or potential new ones, using the telephone, fax machines, direct mail marketing and even in-person meetings. Today, people expect more frequent updates, new information, and the latest of everything. So much so that it is literally impossible to keep up with this dizzying pace and certainly not on a continuing or ongoing basis with any consistency.  Thankfully, blogging has come to the rescue. Setting up a blog on your web site - and having an associated RSS feed - means you can keep in constant touch with your clients and potential customers. Plus you don't have to email them and they can get your latest news without having to visit your web site.",
            "So how does this all work? A blog is really a fancy name for a web page that gets updated regularly. It's nothing special. There are several methods of writing 'blogs', but they are nothing more than computer programs which allow you to easily update a web page. Far and away the easiest way to start a blog is with a popular blog website. One example is called blogger.com.",
            "However, for keeping in touch with your customers, RSS is the key. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. What this means is that your blog can be automatically delivered to people who want to read it - you don't have to send it to them and neither do they have to come and collect it. All they need is the address of your RSS Feed and their RSS Newsreader can do the job for them. There are several RSS readers available and new web browsers incorporate the ability to read RSS feeds and keep them updated.",
            "Whenever you add new content to your blog, the RSS Feed automatically gets updated in everyone's Reader program or web browser. That means you are guaranteed to be able to keep in touch with clients and prospects. You don't have to do anything other than produce the content. Equally, you don't face the problems of email filters and anti-spam programs blocking your email. Furthermore, people tend to read RSS Feeds because they have subscribed to them whereas they tend to ignore non urgent emails.",
            "After a small amount of basic research and reading, you will quickly see, there are numerous advantages to Blogs and RSS Feeds. One of the biggest reasons is that search engines love them. This is because blogs provide fresh and new content - precisely the thing that searchers are looking for. Hence the search engines are actively pushing blogs higher up the search engine ranking. What this means to internet marketers is that if you don't have a blog for your business, you are potentially reducing your chances of a high search engine ranking. You need a blog nowadays to get noticed by the search engines.",
            "For all the reasons mentioned above (and many, many more), blogging is essential. Not only does it improve your web presence, it also means you can keep in touch with clients and prospects more easily. All the marketing research you can find will tell you that regular contact with your customers is a vital component in retaining existing clients, as well as gaining new business. Don\u2019t put it off any longer; it is time to get your blog going---today!"

They can be used either to communicate general information, or as a marketing tool to promote products and services. Although the blog format has been around for a number of years, the way it is being used is still evolving.",
            "The most distinctive thing about a blog is that it is \"content-rich\". Most blogs consist of a number of posts entered on a regular basis. These posts can be short references to some other resource on the net (connected by a link), or long posts which are essentially articles or essays on a specific topic with embedded references to other related sources on the web. This makes them ideal for writers, reporters, journalists, as well as marketers wanting to systematically report on current activities, news of the day, or the features of products.",
            "For instance, blogs are used extensively by bloggers in China to comment on the political and economic scene there. They are used by political advocates in most parts of the world who want to push a certain point of view. They are used by journalists as an alternative medium to communicate their experiences and ideas without them being filtered by large publishers. And blogs are used by corporate communication people to keep in touch with employees and customers by carrying corporate news and comments on the developments within a company or industry.",
            "They are also increasingly used by marketers who want to promote certain products and enhance the search engine exposure of specific websites. If you have a website, or are promoting a website on behalf of a client, then planting references to it in blog posts is a very good way of bringing it to the attention of the search engines.",
            "**Blogs and Search Engines**",
            "Blogs are useful marketing tools because the major search engines pay close attention to them. The structure of blogs makes them easily spiderable, so the major search engines -- Google, Yahoo, and MSN, etc. -- tend to view them as sources of \"news.\" The more active a blog is, the more frequently it will be spidered. If a blog contains new posts every day, it will get spidered every day -- and sometimes more than once a day.",
            "That means that the information in an active blog will show up in search engine indexes much more quickly than changes made to ordinary static websites. Many people think that simply making a change to their website -- for instance, posting a news item on their home page -- will result in that chance of being picked up by the search engines. But this is not the case. The search engines can only reflect that change after the site is spidered. And unless a site has a history of being constantly updated, the search engines will only spider it occasionally.",
            "Therefore when it comes to influencing the search engines, blogs can serve two useful functions. First, as we have seen, an active blog gets spidered regularly. So as long as it remains active a blogger can expect a regular visit to his blog from the search engines to see what is being reported. New posts will get indexed almost immediately, and will start to show up in search engine results.",
            "**Two Important Conclusions about Blogs**",
            "First, if you want to have something reflected quickly in search engine searches, writing about it in a blog is the best way to accomplish this objective.",
            "Second, since the search engines follow links, placing links in your blog posts to other sites to which you want to draw attention to is a good way to get them spidered as well. For instance, say you introduce a new product on your website. The best way to have the search engines visit your site quickly and reindex the changed pages is to make an announcement in an active blog. The spiders will visit the blog, follow the links pointing to your website, and index the changes to the website.",
            "This is why links placed in blog posts are generally the most effective way of drawing attention to other targeted websites.",
            "**Taking Advantage of Blogs**",
            "There are two fairly straightforward ways to take advantage of these important features of blogs.",
            "The first way is to start your own blog. It is surprisingly easy to become a blogger. Many sites offer free blogs that are part of a larger \"community\" of blogs. For instance, go to blogger.com (owned by Google), sign up (for free), and you can have you blog up and running in a matter of minutes.",
            "The problem with this approach is that you may not be a writer, you may not be interested in making regular posts, or you may simply not have anything to say on a regular basis. In that case you might try to find someone who will let you make posts every now and then in their blog -- or at least create links pointing at your website.",
            "Another interesting alternative is to pay someone to review your site, or feature your products every couple of weeks in their blog. That way you get all the marketing and search engine advantages of blogging without actually having to do any of the work."

            "For internet marketing, blogging builds credibility for the website through the many opinions and ideas that are shared there.  The company, and its bloggers, become recognized by their readers as a resource for useful information.  Therefore, people will not only visit once, but will return again and again to find out what else is new.",
            "Blogging itself is an extremely inexpensive, quick, and simple way to reach out to thousands of website visitors.   It draws people who are in your direct target market, making relationship building a much more natural process once that visitor takes their use of your website one step further and makes a purchase of whatever product or service you are selling \u2013 and have been covering in your blog.",
            "Blogs make you an expert in your field. That\u2019s right, with the right researching and writing skills (or with a skilled writer and researcher in your employ) then you can become an expert in your field as far as your website blog is concerned.  To be an expert, all you need to do is keep up with the latest in your industry within your blog posts, and maintain it regularly.",
            "To make sure that you\u2019re headed in the right direction with your blog, check up on other website blogs in your industry to see what they have posted.  Naturally, this doesn\u2019t mean that you should be posting the same things as your competition.  In fact, that is among the worst things that you can do.  Certainly, you\u2019re allowed to share an opinion now and then, but your blog will need to stand out if it is to be taken seriously.  If you are simply reiterating what others are already saying, then you will be seen as old news, and will be overlooked in favor of the original thinkers.",

            "When you post on your blog, make sure that you\u2019re doing it because you have something to say, and not because it\u2019s time to post.  Your blog posts need to be interesting if you are to keep a steady readership.  If you\u2019re not interested in what you\u2019re writing then the odds are that your visitors won\u2019t be interested in what they\u2019re reading.",
            "To keep up the interest, don\u2019t take yourself too seriously.  Of course you are allowed to write about serious and important topics in your industry and about your products, but you can also include some trivia and humorous commentaries that directly or indirectly relate to your blog topic and will amuse your readers.  This is perfectly acceptable in blog posting and is, in fact, encouraged.  It allows the readers to feel that they have made a real \u201ccontact\u201d with you, and that you take a real joy in what you do.",
            "Blogs aren\u2019t just good for creating regular visitors to your website, but they are also quite beneficial for bringing in new visitors as well.  You\u2019ll find that when you are writing about any given topic in your industry, you are using the words and terms that apply to your topic.  As these words become more frequently used throughout your website, for example, within your recent and archived blog posts, search engine spiders will pick up on their use and may increase your ranking for those keywords.",

Of what value is a blog to you, though? Family blogs are becoming increasingly popular because of the way they allow you as a family to keep up with members all over. You can keep members of your family that are located anywhere in the world up to date on happenings in your immediate family including births, deaths, and even marriages. In addition, a family blog is just a good way to get down the things that happen in the day to day life of your family. If you are considering a family blog, then there are some things you should probably pay attention to. Here are a few tips on how to maintain a good family blog.",
            "The first thing to keep in mind with your family blog is safety. A blog may seem safe enough since it is nothing more than words on a web page, but keep a few things in mind. First of all, once you put something up on a blog, it becomes essentially public. Always remember that before you post anything anywhere on the internet, blogs included. Along those same lines, make sure you limit anything that may give readers a hint as to where you live specifically, or any personal information about your children or family in general. Keep addresses, phone numbers, and even email addresses off of the blog because you never know who is looking. Keep safety in mind first, and you are well on your way to a fun and successful family blogging experience.",
            "Once you understand the safety needed with your family blog, you can start adding content. Your content doesn\u2019t have to be anything in particular. Your blog is whatever you want it to be. Keep it updated regularly, though. The reason is that you want to keep those who you want reading the blog doing so with regularity. If you are not updating it regularly, they may stop checking in and that defeats the purpose of your family blog. You want to keep fresh news, ideas, and information that will keep your distant family members reading regularly and with interest. Also, you may want to have some sort of schedule. For instance, you always update on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. That way the readership knows when to check in for new news and information on your family. It will also keep you focused if you have some sort of schedule to go along with it.",
            "Some blog applications include a board for readers to write messages to you or to discuss what is in your blog. If that is the case of the blog you are choosing, then you owe it to your readers to keep an eye on it. If they are posting questions or comments, make sure you are regularly acknowledging or addressing them. If you are working on a family blog, then many of these messages will be from family members that are located far away and so will be a good way to stay in contact with them. Even if they are not family members, your readers will have gained an interest in what you are reading so, with safety in mind, you should still acknowledge them and their questions and comments.",
            "Blogs have become all the rage on the internet in recent years. If you want to get in on the craze, a family blog can be a fantastic way to do just that. A family blog is a great way to keep other family members and far away friends up to date on the happenings within your family as well as some of your personal thoughts and feelings on any number of things. However, there are a couple of tips you should keep in mind as you work on your family blog. Make sure that you are safe and smart with personal information, update regularly, and acknowledge responses to your family blog.

            "Secondly, there\u2019s also TRACKBACK. Now, I was with a friend explaining how trackbacks work last week. Now I\u2019ll tell you. With blogs, for every article that you write, there will be a unique URL for it. And for each article, there\u2019s also a unique trackback URL. Whenever you are at another person\u2019s blog, look for trackback URL, and you may want to copy it.",
            "Now here\u2019s how you use a trackback URL. Let say you are at somebody else\u2019s blog. And he just wrote about something about cat grooming. And somehow, you feel that you have something to say about what he wrote \u2014 and you know, what you want to say will be very long which may not be suitable for a comment. So you write your own message at your blog, and lower down the interface, you enter the other guy\u2019s trackback URL, and then you hit the Submit button.",
            "Now, that new article will appear on your blog. And because you put in a trackback URL, a part of your article will also appear in the other guy\u2019s article as a comment. And that comment links directly back to your article. So that\u2019s how trackbacks work.",
            "Reason #3: Blog Comments",
            "Now, my third point on why blog is better than content-site \u2014 Blog Comments. This is where you able to go around at other blog sites and write some comments on articles. And you even leave a link back to your site. But here\u2019s the thing, just make sure that your comments are genuine, because now days, there are too many people spamming blog comments just to get a link back.",
            "Reason #4: Bloggers\u2019 Linking Habit",
            "OK, here\u2019s some more. This is more a blogging culture thing \u2014 bloggers like to link to each other. If your blog is interesting, it\u2019s easy to get other bloggers to link back to you. Whether you ask for it on your website, or sometimes they just simply give you a link back. I\u2019ve got this many times, and most of the times, they link back write to a specific message. And sometimes, they just list blog sites that they like on their website.",
            "Reason #5: Faster SE Indexing",
            "This is getting quite long already. But I am not done. When it comes to getting traffic, you may not realize this, but it\u2019s easier to get indexed in the search engines with a blog. I don\u2019t know why \u2014 perhaps it\u2019s because incoming links are more natural and you don\u2019t really go around asking for them. And when the incoming links are more natural, I think search engine will prefer it a lot more.",
            "I myself have experienced where new content on my blog was indexed in under seven days.",
            "Reason #6: Repeat Visitors",
            "Now, after you get traffic from search engines, ping sites, and other blogs, later you\u2019ll start to realize that 80-90% of your visitors are repeat visitors. It\u2019s common with a blog. So the point is with this one \u2014 it\u2019s easier to retain visitors with a blog.",
            "You get huge traffic from multiple sources \u2014 and the ones you already have you get to keep. This is different from content-sites, where you really so much on search engine traffic.",
            "Blogging Seems Much More Fun ...",
            "In my experience, starting from scratch, in six month, a content-site may or may not reach to mark of 1000 visitors per day. And it takes serious hours writing content and building incoming links. I have multiple sites consistently doing 100-200 visitors per day, after six month. But with a blog, it\u2019s not unusual if a blog reaches 3000 visitors per day, provided you give good content.",
            "But I suppose, it all boils down to which you are comfortable with.",
            "Realizing this, I may be planning differently in the future \u2014 but I am not certain on that yet. From the looks of it, blogging seems much more fun. You write about what you like, and you network with other bloggers. And the writing part becomes much, much easier with scripts like WordPress and Movable Type. Not much designing, no uploading files, less link building, etc ...",
            "With building content-sites, you still have to build the website again, upload them up to your web hosting, build incoming links, etc ...",
            "This is my opinion. And you may not think the same way I do, based on your personal experience and knowledge. I respect that."

This article will examine the main similarities and differences between a Weblog and a website.",
            "While blogs and website are intended to be different, there are a couple of similarities in blogs and sites. Mainly, they are both found on the Internet using a URL or a web address. Both also must have some sort of host to keep the information online. Another similarity of the two is that they both can be maintained by virtually anyone from individuals to companies. Both Weblog and websites can also contain information, pictures, link and keywords, as well. These two types of sites will target readers.",
            "With a blog, information that is entered on the site is generally updated very frequently depending on the writer. Sometimes blog writers even update several times a day. Usually with a website, information is not updated regularly. Websites generally contain information about something that does not change often. When a website is updated, usually the entire page is altered. With a blog, just one entry at a time is updated. After a website has been changed, that information is gone and cannot be seen again by the reader. On a blog, new entries are added, but the old ones are not deleted from the site. Instead, they are stamped with the date and time that they were created, given a title and indexed on that blog page. It makes it easy for a blog reader to go to a certain blog page and read past entries without having to search.",
            "Another main difference between and blog and a website is that a website is generally a little harder to maintain and oftentimes requires a solid understanding of the way the Internet works. With a blog, almost anyone can easily and quickly update a blog. It does not require any special working knowledge of the Internet. In addition, there are many sites that offer blog features and most of the time these can be used for free.",
            "Blogs also encourage people to communicate with each other much more so than with a website. A websites primary function is to provide some sort of information to a reader. While there may be a place to leave a comment or an email address for writing that is not why that site was created. Blogs are used for communication. Writers may choose to make their site private, but most choose to publish their blogs making them public to any one who wishes to read. Most blog hosting sites offer options to add to the site so readers and the writer can leave comments to each other on the site. In addition, there are entire web communities built just for blogs. Blogs encourage those who have similar thoughts, interests or even businesses to share their blog site so readers can find them easily. Blogs offer guest tracking, keyword tracking, hit counters, comment areas, and even tag boards for both the reader and the writer to use.",
            "Blogging is extremely popular right now. As more people begin sharing their thoughts with others, there are more blogs created each day. Blogging gives writers, journalists, professionals, moms, dads and even teenagers an instant way to publish their thoughts on a regular basis. For those who enjoy writing, blogs give a unique opportunity to practice writing skills and experiment with what others want to read. Businesses use blogs to show off their expertise and knowledge in their fields, whereas websites do not always get this type of message out to the readers.",
            "Blogging and websites do have some similarities. They are both found on the Internet and contain information. However, blogs give a writer the unique opportunity to communicate with their reader and update their entries on a frequent basis. Anyone who tries blogging will love the instant gratification of getting their opinions and thoughts out on the Internet right away and getting instant feedback from readers that visit their site."

            "Blogs are regularly updated which means that they have fresh content on them all the time. This makes them appealing to visitors and search engines alike. Every new posting means new content on your blog and if you update your blogs daily or weekly you will see them grow rather quickly. With fresh content, you can improve your search engine ranking. Whether you use the blog alone, or you used it to accompany an already existing website, your fresh content can be used to draw more and more traffic to either your blog or your website, or both.",
            "Additionally, you can add links to your blogs and start a link exchange campaign.

Want your clients to share there feelings about your products and services? You can use blogs to receive and share client testimonials. There really is no end to the benefits one can derive from using blogs.",
            "What is equally fantastic about blogs is that there are ways that you can create blogs for free. Sites like Blogger, recently purchased by Google, allow you to establish a blog free of charge. Moreover, there are a variety of layouts, fonts, and templates to choose from and Blogger even allows you to post images. Finally, sites like Blogger give you the opportunity to archive your postings so that visits can return to them again and again.",
            "Finally, creating blogs can be simple fun for everyone. No matter what one\u2019s age is, Blogging is the new wave in Internet entertainment. Friends can create clubs and use blogs to establish them, friends and family can share photographs and sentiments, and finally, personal expression can be satisfied when creating blogs.

Communicate with people from all over the world that share the same passions that you do!"

            "5. Collect responses through the ability of blogs to accept comments from your blog readers. Not only does this build your content without any effort on your part, but you can learn and improve your products and services through the feedback from your readers.",

Because there are so many other blogs on the Internet, if you want your blog to be a successful one, it is important to help your blog stand out from the thousands of other blogs that are available to readers. A few simple tips can help make your blog add up to success.",
            "Allowing your readers to leave comments is a great way to make your blog more successful. Even if you are posting random thoughts about your day, you will feel more accomplished if you know someone is reading your work. A successful blog will enable their readers to contact them either through email or through comment boxes on the site. In addition, a successful blog writer can gain more readers by doing the same for other writers. By visiting other blog sites and posting comments, a writer can encourage others to read their blog. In addition, your readers will feel important and included when you respond nicely to their comments. Even if someone responds negatively to your writing, a successful blogger will still thank the reader for his or her opinion. Communication is a great way to a successful blog.",
            "Another way to make your blog writing successful is to look into track backs. A track back is the system used to notify a writer when another writer writes about their blog. It sounds confusing, but it is really simple. If you read a blog by someone else and decide for whatever reason to write about that blog in your own blog, a track back will tell the other writer about your blog. Usually, this will lead to that writer reading your blog and can evolve into communication. Over time, you can even link the blogs together and share readership. Track backs can help start communities of like-minded individuals and get others who might not have otherwise found your blog, to read your blog. Track backs can also increase the amount of traffic to your blog site.",
            "Successful blog writers also make good use of tag boards. Tags are the links that help a reader navigate quickly through a site. Using keywords, a blog can list all entries containing certain keywords together. When a reader wants to read about that one subject, they only need to look at the tag board and select what they are interested in reading. Tagging is highly recommended for blog writers that want to increase their traffic to their site. This is also an important feature for business. Not all blog-hosting sites will offer this feature, but it can be downloaded to most blog sites. When you use this feature, or any feature that involves links to other blogs or websites it is always a good idea to check the links to make sure they work. Readers will become frustrated when the links available on your site are no good.",
            "Another way to a successful blog is to write about what your reader wants to read. This can be done easily when you are able to link with other people with similar interest. For example, if you are a stay at home mom and want to write about your life with a two year old, do not try to get readers that are only interested in pet care. Visit parenting boards and communities and get others with the same interests to visit the site. In addition, make sure that your site is edited for spelling and typing errors before publishing and that you have updated your site frequently. Not updating your blog on a regular basis will lead you to lose readers to other sites that are kept up to date. Also, look into blog hosting sites that eliminates annoying ads or screen pop-ups. Most of the time, you might have to pay a small monthly fee for these ad-free sites, but if you want to build readership, this can be a small price to pay."

Blogs and pinging can get you very good profits in the wrong run. So what exactly are blogs and pinging?",
            "A blog is a website where members can discuss online their views on a particular topic. There are some blogs that are general in nature where people can discuss anything and there are blogs on which you can discuss only on a particular topic. However it is advisable that when you start a blog it should not be generalized but it should be opened on a particular topic. For example instead of starting a blog on the Information Technology you can start a blog only on Microsoft Technologies. There are a lot of blog softwares that you can use on your server and then run it independently.",
            "Blogs are increasingly used for SEO marketing. Through blogs you can advertise your internet site on the blogs. Blog and ping is a process through which you can post a snippet of information from your site to a blog to increase your SEO. When you post snippets of your website information on the blog, search engine sites like Google and Yahoo will find it more easily. The search engine will be able to track your site more easily due to spidering and indexing. You can blog and ping only very important information from your site and not all information. You can also rent links to your site which makes the work of spidering easier for search engines. There were many aggressive marketers before who used to blog and ping all their web pages and that also repeatedly. As a result the search sites termed the individuals spammers and then banned their websites from ranking.",
            "So how is blog and ping done successfully? The tasks can be easily done with the help of softwares like Wordpress and RSS to Blog. Using these softwares you can submit your links to over 50 blog directories at a click of a button. You can download Wordpress and RSS to Blog and then install them on your computer. Once you have installed the programs on your computer you should them customize them according to your needs. Then you should create a list of links from your site that will use in the blog sites. You can do this automatically using RSS to Blog. You can save these links for future use also so that you don\u2019t have to enter the list of links all over again. You also have the ability to add more data to RSS to Blog from external sources. The list of blog entries are automatically modified when you make more entries.",
            "Hence we see that blog and ping are one of the best methods to make your website more famous in the search engines. You can use them and also modify their configuration according to your needs."

The idea is that search engines like blogs because of the ever updating content, so they keep going back. By writing a blog and placing some site links in the posts, the search engines will spider the links, and pages shortly after you blog.",
            "Pinging is when you send a \"ping\" to let the directories, which keep lists of blogs, and when those blogs are updated, know that you have added content to your blog. These are allegedly closely watched by the search engine spiders, so they can spider any new content and add it to the search engine which controls them.",
            "Anyway, back to my experiment, does blogging and pinging really get your site noticed?",
            "Well my results have been encouraging. I have tested by only using a blog as the front page of a new information site I started. http://www.informationpagesonline.com has only been advertised by way of the blog to announce new content, and then pinged through http://www.pingoat.com which distributes the blog entries to several large ping sites.",
            "Following a week of adding content, and then posting an announcement of the new content to the blog on the front page and pinging with pingoat, the site seems to be getting visitors to most of the sections, which I can see from the log files. I can also see some of the traffic is coming from search engines, and also a lot of spider activity can be seen on the site, where the search engines are crawling the content.",
            "So I have to conclude that blogging and pinging  is a way of getting listed on search engines, or at least of getting noticed by them quickly.",
            "Should you be blogging and pinging?",
            "Of course that's up to you, but for the time it takes, it maybe worth trying blog and ping for yourself and tracking the results. A quick blog post (use http://www.blogger.com if you don't already have a blog) and then ping with pingoat takes only a few minutes, and may help a site into all the search engines quickly."

Generally the most recent information on a blog is kept at the top of the page, as blog's are dated log formats. Often they will have commentary of other sites or links directing you to them. Many times the site is dictated by group links and the log is updated frequently. The opinion is this is the very first weblog was back in 1993 it was the Mosaic. This was generally a compiling of links that where kind of disregarded. It took until 1998 for they\u2019re to be a mere handful of these so called blog\u2019s in existence. The blogger all knew each other and were swapping the links between each other.",
            "By the year 1999 this term blog was starting to pick up pace, and as a result became a phenomenon. Once it became free to the public, it really took off and was a pastime that was enjoyed by many. Web logs were hand coded by developers on the web before the software became available. The use of html was the main coding for this program, and the web designers at the time were pretty much the only ones that knew it. Now that this new software is available to the general public, anyone is capable of making a blog. The moment blogger was released in 1999 it became a huge success with the public. Now people are not restricted on what kind of weblog they make, fast-forward to the year 2000 and people are making as many as 300-350 new blogs daily. There is actually a directory for all these blogs, and it contains as many as 5,500 entries. This is now a craze with over 750,000 blog users; this was not merely a passing trend obviously.",

This is because you want to be sure that there is a wide range of products that you can promote.

In particular you will need to be familiar with the Web Host Manager/Cpanel software. Having said that, there are very useful screen capture videos detailing every major process so if you can learn, you can use BFP.",
            "On to the review ... rarely does a piece of software come along which gets my juices flowing like this fantastic offering from a couple of guys who've managed to create what is possibly the most powerful set of tools you could find online to help you profit from blogging.",
            "In case you haven't heard, blogging is all the rage. There are even recognized blog awards putting this modern age phenomenon firmly on the map as something which allows almost anyone the chance to express their opinion and strike up a dialogue with those of a like mind. Very simply, a blog is an online diary with the option of allowing the readers to comment on the entries posted by the blog owner. A blog is a great 'community builder'.",
            "Partly because of the social aspects involved, search engines absolutely love blogs and using them as a way to make money with programs like Google Adsense can be very profitable. Using the free blog software known as WordPress it is very easy to set yourself up with a blog, begin posting content and hopefully begin profiting from clicks on your Adsense.",
            "Once you begin down this route you soon begin to realize that three or four blogs are simply not enough if you want to make good money with contextual advertising programs such as Adsense. This is where it comes down to numbers pure and simple. To make real money using this method you need to dramatically scale up the number of blogs you own.",
            "An initial target would be seven hundred to one thousand WordPress blogs. With this in mind, once you see how long it takes to setup one blog (even though the install process is very simple) you will realize that it could take you a very long time to set up enough blogs to begin making good money. When we are talking these kinds of numbers the system is referred to as a blog farm. Using blog farms there are some very tidy incomes being earned online but it does take work.",
            "For this reason, I was very excited when my friend introduced me to Blog Farm Pro. For a minimal investment you gain access to an exclusive membership site providing you with a comprehensive set of tools which enables you to build anywhere from ten to as many as three hundred blogs or more in one day. I haven't tried to calculate the amount of time this site has saved me but I know we are talking days not hours.",

            "Blog Farm Pro sequentially works through your list of blogs to be created. It actually logs into your web host manager, creates the domain (or sub domain), database and WordPress installation all in one go ... awesome! Once your blogs are created you can give the spider a list of web sites whereupon it will go off and spider those sites posting the content (with a link back) to your specified selection of blogs at a schedule determined by you. Doesn't get much better than that.",
            "The site building tools are also very useful. Here you can create multiple Cpanel domain hosting accounts and any number of sub domains. These tools dramatically increase the speed at which you can create your hosting accounts. If you have ever tried to sit down and create a thousand sub domains you will appreciate how useful these tools actually are.",
            "With the content manipulator, site builder and FTP upload facility, Blog Farm Pro brings weblog/site-building on a massive scale easily within the reach of every web marketer.",
            "The control tools allow you to set your schedules for spider posting and here you can also select the ping schedule. The pinger allows you to specify any number of blogs and ping them from a regularly updated rotating proxy IP list at a schedule you determine (phew!). Again, the seasoned Adsense blogger will absolutely love this feature.",
            "The miscellaneous tools provide you with an article regenerator, single blog, database and cron creators a quick pinger and a list shuffler which are all very handy items to have in your toolbox. The owners of Blog Farm Pro are very responsive and you will always get an answer to any questions you may have on the forums.",

If you want to build massive blog farms in a very short space of time then Blog Farm Pro is definitely worthy of further investigation. The amount of time this package saves you is enough to give you that competitive edge which you need to succeed in the Adsense blogging game.",
            "Just imagine ... you could easily build a thousand blogs in a week - hell you could build three thousand! Now if each one of those blogs only earns you one dollar per month then you would be making one thousand to three thousand dollars a month. Now we're talking!",
            "The idea behind Blog Farm Pro was actually not to create monetised blogs but to use your blog farms as a means of getting your money sites indexed in the engines. The theory goes: build your blog farms, build your sites, post your sites to your blog farms and watch the indexing happen. This works too and whichever way you decide to use BFP I'm sure you'll quickly come to realise that here's a set of tools you really need ... like, yesterday!"

It seems like everyone has a blog nowadays; even William Shatner and Mariah Carey have one. I mean, everyone\u2019s story is unique, right? And since you don\u2019t need to know HTML, FTP or graphic design to create and maintain a weblog, it\u2019s pretty much fair game for all.

If you\u2019re an artist or budding fashion designer, you can gain exposure for your work through an artist blog or fashion blog. Some bloggers even have \u201cfans\u201d and sell merchandise like t-shirts and bumper stickers imprinted with their blog site.

Unless you are a super-model good looking teenage girl who wants to put a lot of photos on your blog, then you are probably going to have a hard time getting noticed. If you already have a vanity blog and are wondering why you are not getting traffic, then you need to know that the vanity blog market is totally saturated. Consider starting or changing your blog to some other topic \u2013 an interest or a hobby for example.",
            "Next, you need to start posting to forums. Put the URL of the blog in your forum signature (don\u2019t spam forums saying \u201clook at my blog\u201d). If you just join in the conversation naturally, then people will get curious and you will get a few more readers. If the forum you post in is also to do with a similar topic to your blog then you will probably get repeat readers from it! Try to find the most popular forums in the niche you are writing about. To find them, just go over to Google and search for your niche keyword plus \u2018forum\u2019 and you should get a list. Try to find forums with at least a few thousand active members.",
            "Make sure to do trackbacks and pingbacks to other blogs that you have linked to so that they know about you. When people find out that you have talked about them, they will come to see what you said. So will some of their readers. Talking about popular stories from popular blogs may get you more than just a few visitors too.",
            "Comment on other people\u2019s blogs as much as you can (without spamming). In most cases you can put a link back to your own blog and people do follow these links. It is also good to target blogs that talk about the same subject as you, because then you will get targeted readers who are more likely to continue reading your blog. (Avoid using \u201ccomment spam\u201d programs as Google can track this and will penalize you).",
            "Most importantly, you need to keep blogging! Nobody will return to a blog that is updated weekly or only occasionally. You need to add more content at least once per day, especially in the early stages of getting your blog noticed. This is hugely important.",

This can take a while, but if they do list you in the index, you will see a larger increase in traffic.

There are ways to do this without needing to pay anyone at all.",

When you do this, you have an edge over the competition. When you know exactly what the people are looking for, you can give them just that. Once you have a list of keywords, simply create articles that use these keywords. By creating these articles, you are putting yourself out there to be found. When someone does a search for those keywords, your blog just might pop up on their screen. Be careful not to use the keyword so much that your article does not make sense however.",
            "Daily Updates",
            "If you really want the best optimization, you should update it daily at the least. The more you update it, the more often search engines will index your blog. Therefore, you will want to be sure your blog is always fresh. Adding new information is the best way to update your blog. The more new information you have, the better off you will be! Just be sure that when you do update, it is for a good reason. You should always remember that content can have a purpose, but it should always be quality content. If you compromise content, you are only allowing yourself to strip the creativity from your project. If you are happy with doing that, by all means go ahead. However, as a writer, you will have a certain responsibility to web surfers. Unless you want everything on the web to be useless, do your part!",
            "Use these tips to help optimize your blog and get the most from search engines. The more you post and use these tips, the more results you will see. If you earn your living from the number of clicks your blog or your ads get, this will essentially mean more money for you. You can use all of them or some of them. Experiment with them to see what works best for you and your blog. Put these tips to use and watch your results rise today!"

Do the same with your message \u2013 don\u2019t post a 2-line message. Instead, create an article-like comment that brings some updated news on a particular topic and then adapt this message to the context of the blog you are posting on.",
            "* It\u2019s a good idea to select 30-40 blogs that have high traffic and excellent search engine rankings and be a constant poster. At first, convince the blog owners that you are not a spammer by posting relevant comments without any links or promotional language. Once you prove to be \u201cone of the team\u201d you can insert some non-intrusive links to your website, which they will produce excellent results!"

            "Blogs and blogging are sweeping the internet. They are all the rage as a hobby, writing exercise, and even a career for some. In fact, it is even becoming more common that bloggers are seeking a way to make money. Be it via advertising or affiliations, they each have their own way of pursuing that writing career by way of the blog. There is another way, though. There is an alternate way to make a little extra money by blogging. That way is not unlike the way waiters, cab drivers, and even bellhops add to their income: the tip. Wait a minute! How do you get tips from your blogging? There are ways, and if you read on you will see that they aren\u2019t as difficult as you might think.",
            "First of all, if you want people to tip you for your blog, you have to give them a reason for doing it. You need to be providing very good information or highly entertaining copy that makes them feel like you earned it. In essence, you are the web equivalent to a street performer by working for tips. So, like that street performer, you owe your audience something that makes them feel like you are worth their money. So polish your writing, update it often, keep it fresh, and stay true to the topics your readers are used to. If you are all over the place, you won\u2019t be able to build the loyal audience necessary when you go to start asking for tips. Basically, the start of it all is your content. Just like with any other money making web venture, your content is going to go a long way. So to get started earning tips from your blogging, make sure you give the audience a reason.",
            "Once you have your content set up, you need to promote it. Asking for tips won\u2019t do you a bit of good if you don\u2019t have an audience to ask. Market your blog, market your topics, and target those search engines. Don\u2019t do any of it at the expense of the quality of your content, but make sure you are getting something going in the way of marketing. Register with blog directories, post to other people\u2019s blogs, and generally get your name and blog site out there so that you will drive an audience into what is hopefully quality, informative, and or entertaining content. Again, if there is nobody at the site then asking for a tip is not going to do you a lot of good.",
            "Next, since you have set up your content to be useful and entertaining to a particular audience and you have begun to get your blog marketed, you are almost ready for those tips. However, there needs to be some sort of vehicle available to your readers to get the tips to you. I mean if they have to do a lot of work to get money to you then you probably shouldn\u2019t count on the money rolling in. There are a number of online methods available for receiving payments via email or the web. It would be wise to have one located prominently on your blog so that if a reader is stuck with the desire to tip you, he or she can do so with ease and without a lot of time that may result in rethinking the tip. Remember, this is something you want to happen when your quality and entertainment is fresh in their minds.",
            "Finally, if you really want to earn tips from blogging, then you should probably ask for them in some way. You can do so in the blog posts or even with some sort of message on the main page of your blog that states that tips are appreciated and are the way you fund the blog. Either way, you need to make it clear to the readers that you are reliant on their generosity without sounding like you are hard selling, or worse, begging.",
            "Blogging can be a lot of fun, and can actually make you a little money if you are willing to work hard at it. One way of making that money is by earning tips from your readers. There are some things that you need to get in place though to make that work. Make sure you have quality content, market your site, set up a method for receiving the tips, and be sure to ask for them. If you do those things, then you can be earning tips from your blog before you know it."

After a serious optimization campaign and the ensuing positive results that can be analyzed in detail and carefully measured, business blogs should be considered as an added way to help increase Search Engine rankings in the major Search Engines, while at the same time more effectively communicating new ideas, products or services to the business community, your clients, prospects, suppliers, business associates, etc.",

            "<strong>Bad headlines.</strong> They're frustrating. Some bloggers like to get creative... but creativity can affect search engine keyword opportunities. The important thing is that readers have a hint of what the post is about.",
            "<strong>Links.</strong> Readers like to know where links take them and most of us rely on the status bar, but sometimes that doesn't help. Some experts say to use \"click here\" to help those who are newer to the Web and others say that's wrong, wrong, wrong. It just depends on the content. When linking, try to pick the best words that give readers an idea of what to expect.",
            "<strong>Calendars as the only way to navigate a blog</strong> and <strong>impossible to find archives</strong> or older entries are big problems. I almost always resort to search when I want to find postings no longer on the home page. Unfortunately, some blogs don't have search. That's why I put \"archive\" links in my sidebar in both <a href=\"http://www.meryl.net/blog/\">meryl's notes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.meryl.net/articles/\">meryl's notes features</a>. As my site goes through redesign, I'm making sure the archives are accessible especially in the features section. I found some old entries from 2001 that are still relevant today.",
            "<strong>Bloggers must be regular.</strong> No bathroom jokes here, please. :) When a blog looks abandoned for a month... your audience is gone. They'll take you off their feed reader and blogroll. If you plan not to do it again or take a long sabbatical... prepare to start over again when you return.",
            "<strong>Keep the boss in mind</strong> even if your the head honcho. Always blog with a boss in mind. Will your boss (current and future) be offended by your posting? Not only do people get fired for their blogs, but also they could cost job offers. It wouldn't surprise me if managers are Googling applicants while going through the interview process.",
            "<strong>Junky URLs.</strong> Nielsen says having a typepad.com or blogspot.com equates to having a yahoo.com or aol.com email address. Some of the bigwigs use Blogspot or Typepad URLs. Guess what? I never remember their URLs. I have to rely on Google. So this makes sense, BUT I wouldn't call it unprofessional.",
            "Business blogging has many benefits and problems. Companies tread carefully when entering this new world. It's wise to have policies on the approval process and what can and can't be said. Like anything else in a business, blogs need to be evaluated to determine whether or not they fit the business' model."

Blogs are perfect for practically any thought ever expressed.  Good or bad.  Blogs are freedom of speech on steroids.  Where else can your share your thoughts on everything from civil war to civil rights?  You can create a blog about your dogs eating habits. Your topic is only limited to your imagination.",

As the technology advances, I can't imagine what blogs will be like in 20 years. You can create a blog with pictures, movies,audio and obviously the written word, which still is the most powerful.",

Now some people take them with them where ever they go.",

The first thing that you should do is read as many  blogs as you can  before you create a blog.  This way you can see the different  ways people express themselves to give you ideas on how far you want to go..",

Depending on how many visitors you get to your blog, you can earn a good amount of money for basically doing nothing..",

Well that's the job description of a blogger. That, however, is the not the whole story! There are very, very few bloggers who have nothing else to do but work on their blog and even fewer who have a blog that provides a decent source of income so blogging is, for most, a second or even a third \u201cjob.\u201d",
            "There are two basic types of bloggers, the casual blogger and the serious blogger.",
            "The casual blogger may have a basically well balanced life and a blog that is primarily a hobby. The casual blogger will start writing a post, work at it for awhile and then stop to get some other things done until he or she feels like writing again. If a finished post doesn't get many comments, that's OK; the post expressed just what the casual blogger wanted to say and its out there if anyone is interested.",
            "The serious blogger's situation is quite different from the casual blogger's. The serious blogger has a blog that he or she considers to be a job -- a job that may be competing with other important elements of life such as a primary job, a family, a social life and adequate rest. The serious blogger is committed (almost to the point of an obsession) to maintaining his or her blog and feels it is an essential element of daily life. The serious blogger feels dejected if any post sits on the blog for twenty-four hours or so without generating a comment or if the blog's \u201chit counter\u201d does not register a certain number of visitors every day. That kind of commitment to blogging may take a big hunk of time out of the day and can easily create some serious conflicts between blogging and the rest of life -- to avoid this, the serious blogger needs to be organized and efficient.",
            "Time management for the serious blogger! Anyone who feels that the day is too short needs to understand and implement the basic principle of time management: setting priorities. Some things are obviously more important than other things but some important things may be left undone unless you are controlling your schedule and not having random events control you. You need to set priorities and live by them.",
            "Make a priority list! To begin setting priorities, make a list of everything you need to get done -- everything including things you've committed to doing, things you want to do, things you know you should do and things that you really don't want to do but are on your mind. Be honest and put everything on the list -- take a couple hours or more to put it together if you need that much time, it will be time well spent because you are about to get organized.",
            "Important: You will be using and modifying this list every day so create the list using some program that will allow you to move list items around, add items, remove items and save the list. Just notepad or your word processing program will do nicely but there are other more specialized programs available -- they may even be free, check out: Tucows at tucows. com.",
            "Categorize! Now carefully consider each item on the list and put each one into one of the following five categories.",
            "Must get it done today",
            "Must get it done this week",
            "Nice to do and might be beneficial",
            "Nice to do but not really necessary",
            "Unnecessary",
            "Now you have a decent priority list. Start every day with this list and every time you become aware of a new task add it in a proper place to the proper category. As the \u201cmust do\u201d items are accomplished and moved off the list, some of the nice-to-do items may be moved up, but only if their priorities can honestly be changed.",
            "Too many must-do things! If the list of items in the two \u201cMust get it done . . . \u201d categories is overwhelming, reconsider each item's importance and re-prioritize if you can, if not select the items that you really don't have to do yourself, things like fix-it projects, business phone calls, business letters, editing and proofreading jobs, etc. -- some of these things may be able to be done just as well by someone else. Find a friend, family member, co-worker or a freelancer to do it for you."

            "For example, in March of 2006, the domain name Blue.com sold for $500,000. The site now includes links to adult sites and airfares. The seller, Amy Schrier, bought the site in 2002 for $65,000. In the United States, approximately one to two thousand people make their living buying and selling domain names.",

            "Most of the vendors buy or register domain names, then develop the sites' commercial value by adding content and links to increase marketability. It is an investment in virtual real estate.",
            "Sales of 5,851 domain names generated 29 million dollars in 2005, almost twice as much as the year before. Investors seeing the potential for further increases are buying or investing in domain name companies. For example, in 2005 Highland Capital invested $20 million in YesDirect, a domain name company holding 600,000 names. YesDirect is developing content for the sites it holds.",
            "There are even trade shows being hosted in Las Vegas to bring together domain name buyers and sellers. A recent Las Vegas trade fair attracted approximately 400 to 500 vendors and investors, twice the attendance compared to 2005. A large live auction at the fair generated $2.1 million in sales within three hours.",
            "Online entrepreneur Gary Kreman earned $12 million in cash and stock in 2005 by selling Sex.com to Escom, an adult entertainment firm. The site Men.com was sold in 2003 for $1.3 million, a huge profit for its owner who paid $15,000 for the domain name in 1997.",
            "Dozens of internet sites such as Afternic specialize in selling domain names for a commission, usually approximately 10% of the selling price. Some of the sites will list any domain name for whatever price the owner asks; others are more discriminating in the sites they will list, preferring single-word domain names rather than concatenated phrases.",
            "The most valuable domain names are the .coms, followed by .net, .org and .biz. Single word websites are the most valuable, though not all single words will have the same high value. Concatenated phrases are slightly less valuable than single words, those with hyphens less than those without. Short words and phrases are also preferred. Not all words have the same commercial potential. For sellers unsure of the value of their site, most of the domain name resale sites have appraisal services available for between $15 to $30 per site examined."

Actually the role of web sites is rapidly being re-defined but it is clear blogs will be the place where all the traffic will be congregating for a long time to come. What some thought was a passing fad is clearly here to stay and is a permanent development that has already had far reaching effects on communications and the way we transmit and receive information.",
            "Yet most entrepreneurs who have quickly jumped onto the blog bandwagon do not seem to fully understand and appreciate what blogs are really all about. Worse still, many of those who have remained away have no idea what all the fuss is about.",

            "Everybody can be a publisher or media owner",
            "Probably the most significant impact of blogs is the fact that it is rapidly changing mass media, as we have known it since the invention of the printing press in the 15th century. Powerful media companies have been in the hands of a few people who have carefully controlled what we see in our media. Sometimes deliberately to achieve their corporate goals and objectives. Blogs are effectively transferring that power back to the people and away from the hands of a few.",
            "This era of blogs means that anybody can be a publisher or media owner and effectively transmit whatever information they want and push whatever cause is dear to their hearts. The impact of blogs in politics for example has been a clear demonstration of the power of blogging. We have some blogs covering politics that have a couple hundred thousand visitors on a daily basis.",

For example during the Tsunami tragedy last December. Footage of the damage being caused by the giant waves was seen in blogs long before the traditional media channels got wind of what was going on.",

            "Distinct advantages of having a blog",
            "Blogs tend to get lots of traffic. Lots more than websites do. Besides search engines seem to love them. Blogs are also able to build up links much more easily than web sites. Thus it is no longer surprising for a nobody-novice to suddenly shoot up in stardom and recognition.",
            "No entrepreneur can afford to be left behind",
            "The benefits of a business having in it's stable a blog or two that is capable of attracting huge traffic, is very important and can be extremely useful in helping a business to achieve its' marketing goals and objectives.",
            "Any entrepreneur whether online or offline who does not have a blog to help promote their business is making a very serious mistake that they will definitely live to deeply regret. In fact even playing catch-up with a blog that already exists will continue to be more and more difficult.",
            "There are a number of advantages that blogs have which will continue to be extremely useful to entrepreneurs and webmasters. One of them is the fact that they easily allow for customer comment and anybody can be able to post a comment at your site. In a way this is a form of research and sampling because it enables the business to get feedback and thus be able to gauge the sort of response they will receive when they finally roll out their product or service into the market.",

If your sponsor does not have a lot of galleries to use you're going to have to use several sponsors for each of your Blogs to keep them updated on a regular basis. After 10-15 days when the first posts are buried well out of site repeat them. You are after surfers coming from Search Engines and you are laying down spider food. It is a lot like fishing. You are putting out bait both for the surfer and for the spiders or bots from the Search Engines",

            "These scenarios that represent three versions of you in the real world are also three (of many) approaches you can take to presenting yourself to your readers in the virtual world, through your blog: as a character of your creation, as the professional at whatever you do, or as the real, unadulterated you, complete with flaws. Your blog and your blogger persona are your creations and are limited only by your choices. Consider also that whatever it is you write, in whatever form, even if it is spoof or satire, it will be considered by your readers as an expression of your true feelings.",
            "People express themselves in many ways and for a growing number of people the need for some sort of public expression of thoughts, feelings, style or creative expression is filled by blogging. Expressing your thoughts in written words, however, is not as simple a task as it may seem to be; many people, in fact, find that it can take hours to accurately transfer the most seemingly simple thoughts to the written word. Thoughts and feelings do not require the organization or structure that is required by the expression of those thoughts and feelings.",
            "Some things that make the task of expressing yourself through your writing much easier are improving your grammar, improving your vocabulary and practice, practice, practice.",
            "Grammar! As a rule you should always write to your audience -- they are the ones who need to understand you. Perfection may be necessary when you are writing for an audience of scholars and grammarians who require it but, regardless of your audience, the better your grammar the better you will be understood and the easier it will be for you to transfer those thoughts to paper. There are literally hundreds of English grammar guides available online and very reasonable English grammar guides available in bookstores; good grammar is a tool you will never regret learning to use.",
            "Vocabulary! Finding the right words to express your thoughts is much easier when you have more words in your armory to choose from. You may be tempted to learn some suitably obscure words to impress your readership but too much of that will only confuse them and turn them away from your writing. Research has shown that the average adult in the U.S. reads at an eighth-grade level so arming yourself with a recondite vocabulary will not be helpful (nor was our reference to a 'recondite vocabulary' unless you knew that recondite means \u201cdifficult to understand\u201d). Arm yourself, instead, with a good dictionary/thesaurus.",
            "Write Often! Practice makes perfect or, to be honest, it at least helps you approach perfection. Try to make a meaningful entry in your blog every day, that may not always be possible but do try! Two of the wonderful things about blogging are its flexibility and availability -- your blog will always be there (baring computer problems) when you need it and you'll find that the more you write, the easier it will be to write. Keep in mind, however, that even a professional writer who writes for hours every day is seldom completely satisfied that the words that came out adequately express the thought that went in so don't allow yourself to get too frustrated, take a short break and then try again."

            "Blogs. Most people have either heard of them, read them, or have created their very own. Blogs or blogging has become very popular across the internet recently.  Blogging is seen as something to do for fun, for a hobby, or in thinking and reflecting on the experiences you are writing about. This holds truth as some of the most common uses for blogging are personal, yet few realize the power of blogging. Though blogging is a way to interact and connect with others, there are many other uses for it.",
            "Blogging is a great way to share knowledge and gain knowledge. For example, if someone has a question they can ask it on their blog where they can potentially get a lot of good answers and suggestions. Blogging is a good way to communicate with others across long distances. Blogging is, of course a great way of self-expression and self-promotion. It can be a safe haven for some who are otherwise more inhibited to be able to speak their mind and give their opinions on a certain subjects without having to show their face. Blogging can be used to track experiences, somewhat like a diary or journal, where there are daily entries that are dated. Blogging can also be utilized in storytelling. They are used in campaigning to get the word out about whatever the issue may be. Imagine how many people surf the web and can potentially see your issue. Great things can happen with such a huge audience involved.",
            "Blogging can help in building community amongst different types of people. Blogging is also a great way to meet business partners. Some of the up and coming uses include opportunities in corporations and education, entertainment, health care, and government.",
            "Blogging can also broadcast information, such as news rapidly one place to another. Therefore it\u2019s possible to learn about various events before they are even reported through T.V. and newspapers etc.  Another benefit of blogging is that it can increase visits to a website, which is great marketing. What better way to get people to your site for free. Blogs are practical everyday tools, like email. The blogging boom is on and it\u2019s wise to get on board while it gains popularity. Whatever your blog is used for, it can help you out in a positive way. Blogging has definitely become professional in its use. So go out and start your blog!"

I\u2019d rather go see my friend Dan Sorrentino at Newtown Hardware for my sundries than some guy I don\u2019t know that I have to walk the length of a football field to find. But I know a lot of people who visit Wal*Mart on a regular basis. FYI, Wal*Mart has an affiliate program through LinkShare that is okay. Wal*Mart also has a blog, called Wal*Mart Facts.",
            "Since it is the largest retail outfit in the world, Wal*Mart has a pretty big target painted on its back. It\u2019s always taking a beating for its employment practices or lack of this or corporate that. Being a PR person for Wal*Mart must be pretty tough. According to the Strategic Public Relations Blog, Wal*Mart is trying to soften its public face. To this end it has hired the venerable public relations firm Edelman in Chicago.",
            "According to the Modern Marketing blog, Edelman and Wal*Mart set up a program they call Action Alley. Action Alley was set up to practice what Modern Marketing calls Outside In marketing:",
            "Traditional marketing has been built around the idea of creating a central set of messages and sending them out into the marketplace.",
            "This can be thought of as an \u2018Inside-Out\u2019 approach, where the communications infrastructure required to manage brands and image (cameras, editing suites, media, design & creative personnel) is held inside large organisations and used to distribute information out.",
            "However, as savvy consumers filter out unwanted advertising information using PVRs, adblockers, SPAM filters, RSS feeds, subscriptions and customer communities, the Inside-Out approach is becoming less and less effective.",
            "Not surprisingly, some companies are looking around for new ideas. Open Source Marketing is one idea that people are turning to as they realise that the values behind the Open Source Movement can be applied to industries beyond technology.",
            "The Open Source approach can be described as \u2018Outside-In\u2019. It recognises that in a distributed environment a lot of information and content about a company or brand is being produced outside of the organisation by consumers and other stakeholders. And that companies need systems that allow them to react to this information.",
            "It also recognises that frequently this information is more influential than the spiel produced by a company or brand. For example, someone looking to book a hotel will probably place greater value on a customer community such as virtualtourist.com than a hotel website.",
            "Having lived a lot of my life around marketing weenies, I can tell you that outside-in marketing scares the living hell out of marketing people, because it means they\u2019ve lost control of their brand and their message, and they\u2019re not just pulling levers and watching what happens.",
            "Getting back to Wal*Mart, the marketing weenies there perceived that what was being said in the Blogosphere was nibbling away at their brand. They\u2019re probably right. The job of Action Alley is apparently to help -ahem- steer those out in the Blogosphere toward writing more positively about Wal*Mart.",
            "According to the Motley Fool a guy named Brian Pickrell wrote a blog article suggesting that the State of Maryland telling Wal*Mart how much employee health insurance they have to provide might be a bad idea. Without reading the article I would probably agree with him. According to the Fool, his article sounded a lot like a press release created by Edelman.",
            "So the rigamarole seems to be about Wal*Mart\u2019s conspiracy in feeding news stories to influential bloggers to try to influence what they write. Of course they do. So does everyone else, and to say otherwise is either naive or stupid. That is what public relations are all about.",
            "While I was laughing at this whole thing something very, very cool struck me \u2014 all the hubbub is because a company that earns $30 million a day is trying to influence a bunch of bloggers, rightfully believing that they have a lot of influence on the brand, and wrongly believing that they have any influence over them.",
            "We bloggers aren\u2019t stupid, you know. We may use your marketing tripe propoganda, but the marketing weenies have to understand that the only reason we use it is because we agree with it. And while the purists can squawk, I don\u2019t see any problem with that.",

The same happens in reverse for the one you link back to.",
            "Sooner than you think both of your blogs will become ones that a circle of people read. The more blogs you do this with, the more your circle will eventually grow.",
            "Don\u2019t be too concerned with page rank. Many of the established blogs with good page rank are not going to link to you until you build up your readership at least a little. There is a reason for this and it isn\u2019t arrogance, though it may feel that way at times.",
            "The reason is that many people start blogs, but few people actually become bloggers. Blogging daily takes a commitment that many are not willing to make. The established blogs might link to you regardless of page rank and traffic issues if they see you are committed to writing your blog and becoming a blogger.",
            "They don\u2019t want to link to someone\u2019s blog that may or may not be around next month. It is a disservice to their readers and a hassle to remove your link later or check and see if you are actually still blogging. They do not have the time to hold your hand on it.",
            "If they check out your blog and you have been posting to it every day for quite awhile, say 6 months at least, then they might give you a helping hand and welcome you to the blogosphere.",
            "Put it into your schedule to make a post every single day, even if it has to be a short one due to lack of time. When there is a time you know you will not be able to post for a few days, make a post for each of those days and if you are using wordpress you can timestamp the posts so that each one appears on the scheduled day. That is one way to keep your blog fresh for your readers every day.",
            "Another tip is, as we post to our blogs daily, there are times when you have two or three things you want to blog, but if you are finding it hard to post daily, timestamp the second or third post for other days rather than posting them right now unless it is something time sensitive. Try to stay two or three days ahead so that if you miss a day, it won\u2019t hurt you.",
            "If you are using blogger or other blogging software that doesn\u2019t have the timestamp feature, save them as drafts, then log in when you have little time and post your draft. If you have time to blog a post, then leave the draft there until you need it.",
            "Don\u2019t let yourself get frustrated if everyone doesn\u2019t want to link to you right away. If you are blogging good content, you may find they are linking to you before you even ask!"

            "But blogs are a special breed of web-site. There are additional methods of getting new visitors to your blog that are very effective. The first one I played with was linking to others. For your blog marketing efforts to work, you must understand that bloggers are part of a community. Those of us old-timers on the \u2018net remember when the entire \u2018net was a small, close-knit community\u2026 when it was OK to send an email telling others in your topic area that you just set up a site and would like a link on their site.",
            "That isn\u2019t what I\u2019m suggesting with the blog community. The days of sending even a personal email to someone you haven\u2019t met are nearly over. The spam problem has made that more and more difficult. However, it is still OK and still rather expected that you introduce yourself when you come into a community. It is also a good idea to let your new community know that you are a friendly guy and are willing to help out in the community.",
            "This post will tell about one way to do that when you enter the blogosphere. First, you should find your neighbors. The Alexa toolbar is going to help you find out who the leaders are in your new community. Start by searching for \u201c______ blog\u201d on Google, Yahoo or your favorite search engine. Fill in the blank with the topic of your blog. Take a look at the blogs you see.",
            "Do you like them? Good; these are leaders in your new community. Link to them in your blog roll. Read them daily to find out what is going on in your community. Do you not like them? No problem. Don\u2019t link to them then. Don\u2019t read them. Don\u2019t introduce your visitors to them. It isn\u2019t required that you like everyone in your new community, but you do want to be a part of the community you now live in\u2026",
            "Now as you read those blogs daily, notice their blog rolls (links they have to other blogs in your community). Go visit them. This is where the Alexa toolbar comes in. You will find some new leaders (those with blogs showing less than 100,000 on your Alexa toolbar). Check out their blog and if you like it\u2026 add it to your own blog roll.",
            "I recently moved to a town of about 300 way up in the top of the Utah mountains.  It was a new community. I had never lived in a rural area before, so it was critical for me to go through this exact same exercise as I became a part of my new community up here in the mountains. Sure; it didn\u2019t involve Alexa or linking to others\u2026 but the concept is the same. When you enter a community and want to be a part of that community, get out there and get to know people. This is one way to do that in the blogging community.",
            "I now have a hundred or so links from those in the blogging community after just a couple of months. From those links, I have over 600 daily visits and over 100 loyal readers who come to read my blog almost every day.",
            "Did I ask for any of those links? Nope. Just like they didn\u2019t ask me for the links I gave them. Do I have 100 outbound links? Nope. A lot of those links came in without me linking to them. As I get the chance, I go and check out their blog and if I like it\u2026 I give them a link. If I don\u2019t like that blog for whatever reason; I don\u2019t include it in my blog roll. It\u2019s not always a tit for tat link exchange.",
            "Some of you may be confused at this point about how my outbound links became inbound links without any other action. You may be confused about why I called this article \u201cGetting Blog Visitors\u201d when I have only talked about how to send my visitors to others by linking to them. OK; let me go into why this uniquely works very well on blogs, but not on other web-sites.",
            "First, of all\u2026 I use Wordpress. It is the fastest growing blogging software out there. I\u2019m not sure of the features of other blogging software, but I know the follow applies to Wordpress. When I log in to my control panel to write a blog post, I am given a page that shows a number of blog stats.

            "When you see that a blog called \u201cMattress Cleaners\u201d just linked to you\u2026 can you ignore that? I can\u2019t. I\u2019m immediately distracted\u2026 and what do I do? I click on it. I go and check out that Mattress Cleaner blog. They just got another reader (at least for that day). If they were a quality blog that was actually relevant to the blog community of my own blog (and they aren\u2019t)\u2026 they would get a link in my blog roll so that I could check them out periodically.",
            "The same thing is possible with non-blog web-sites. When you link to a site and send them traffic, that shows up in their referrer logs. However, a lot of webmasters don\u2019t look at their logs or stats. Those who do may use stat software that doesn\u2019t even show referrers. They may only focus on traffic and not where it comes from.",
            "However, most bloggers DO see when someone links to them. It is right in their face when they login to make a new post. All you need to do to let someone know that you have moved into their blog community is to link to them. BTW, it not only introduces you\u2026 it lets them know that you are friendly and you like their part of the blog community you just entered. Don\u2019t be surprised when they link back or even write a post about your blog.",

Blog exposure is important and one way to get this type of exposure is through blog indexing.",
            "Readers can find a blog about almost any topic in the world and in any language. A blog index helps readers find what kind of blog they are most interested in reading. Some blog indexing sites list several different topics to choose from and then list blogs that relate to a particular topic. For blog writers this can mean increased exposure to a blog site.",
            "Blog indexing can also include indexing your blog pages within your site. When you add an entry to your blog, it will be included with a link on your site. Keeping these links can help readers go back and read your past entries. Many times, when you include certain keywords within your blog writing, a search engine can also pull up your past blog entries. This makes it easy for your readers to catch up with current entries as well.",

When a blog is indexed, it helps readers easily locate your site. If you do not index your site, it still may be found using a search engine; however, the link will be blank if the entry is old or if you have removed it for whatever reason. Indexing your pages and including searches to your blog site means that a reader can enter your blog they are looking for and produce results.",
            "When you get ready to index your blog pages and implement searches, there are few tips that can help readers easily locate your entries. One easy top is to keep your page noticeable. This means that you want to keep your search options easily accessible for your reader. Also, enter your blog on as many search engines sites that you\u2019re possible can. Many search engines sites such as Google and Yahoo have steps you can use to enter your web site on their search engine. This process may take a couple of weeks, but it is well worth it if you are interested in more exposure through your blog.",
            "Another way to increase the traffic on your blog with indexing and searching, make sure all of your links works. Check your links often and make sure that they are leading your readers to your site or to where you want them directed. Also, if you change your web blog location, you will need to update your search engines or include a link from your old site to your new site. If a reader clicks on your link to get to your blog and finds that it is no good, chances are that they will not attempt to find your location.",
            "You can also increase traffic to your blog site by using a blog-hosting site that is easy to use and that offers features such as searches and indexing. There are many blog sites that are available to those that want to blog, but some may not offer the type of features you want to use. If you choose to keep your blog personal and private, then you will not need to worry about indexing or entering your blog on a search engine.",
            "Blogging can be a great way to share your writing with others. In order to make sure that you have the maximum amount of exposure to your blog consider indexing and search engines.

            "1)RSS. Everyone who publishes online has some degree of knowledge (or should!) of RSS - which in our non technical parlance will simply refer to Real Simple Syndication. Essentially RSS, from a publisher's standpoint, simply allows you to aggregate and collect information from around the web in small chunks, usually in the form of headlines and small snippets of content, which you can publish on your site, and will update for you automatically as the originators of the content add more items. Essentially, your site will be augmented with free information and content, published by other people which keeps YOUR site updated with a free flow of good information, AND benefits the other publishers as well as their content is effectively syndicated around the web, extending their reach and circle of influence. A win/win for both parties, and your readers too!",
            "2)Blog comments. Many smart marketers have been using this method for years, and it amazes me how many people I consult with are OBLIVIOUS to this great source of entertaining and interactive content you can enjoy on autopilot. A good blog has an engaged audience. An engaged audience wants to be heard. And the ability to comment, allows them to be. They will interact with YOUR content, with each other, and with industry news. The buzzword going forward in the online marketing space is undoubtedly COMMUNITY. Strong communities make for strong sites, and even stronger bank statements..:-) If you are running ANY form of advertising on your site, do not even consider turning \"comments\" off on a blog install. Yes it is a pain in the butt to manage. Yes you will get SOME spam, but thankfully not much due to great anti-spam plugins readily available to you for free. But NOTHING kills a conversation quicker than a monologue. Your blog comments are a great source of organic traffic from the search engines and social networks, as well as a compelling force in keeping your one time visitors coming back often, interested, engaged and entertained! Good luck and don't forget to ask questions if you have them..:-)",

A great way to get started blogging quickly (and for free) is to use an online \u2018standalone\u2019 service like WordPress or Google\u2019s Blogger.  These are free, highly customizable tools that support both new and more advanced bloggers.    The negative is that you can\u2019t use your website\u2019s domain name.  For instance, if using Blogger, you blog address would be something like \u2018yourblog.blogspot.com.\u2019  While you can link to this from your current website, search engines won\u2019t know give you \u2018credit\u2019 for the extra content since it is a different domain.  With creative cross linking however, you can still benefit from the increased exposure you can get from a blog.",

While some people prefer to use more basic blog services, they too can truly benefit from the \u2018built-in\u2019 benefits of WordPress or Blogger along with its existing large community of users.",
            "One of the most notable benefits of these services is the ease of use, and advanced functionality of the service compared to some blog software applications. Neither Blogger nor WordPress require you to know any \u2018coding\u2019 and allow you to built and post to your blog with easy to use icons similar to what one would see in a word processing program. Having the ability to utilize a program like this allows people to create blogs that are as high tech, and complete as full blown websites.",
            "If you are occasionally \u2018offline\u2019 you can benefit from WordPress\u2019s ability to import posts.  This means you can put your blog together while you are not connected to the internet and then import it later.  If you already use another blogging service such you can also import your posts directly into Blogger or WordPress.",
            "Another benefit of these services is their large widget or element and theme libraries that allow you to instantly add useful features, and professional looking styles to your blog.  A very simple drag and drop interface allows you to add features such as an RSS feed with a few clicks.",
            "Another option to consider would be blogging software that you can directly integrate into your website.  Some hosting provides such as GoDaddy allow you to use your existing domain name for you blog.  The benefit is that the content of your blog becomes part of what search engines see for your domain.  In these cases you are more likely to pay a monthly add-on fee to your hosting provider. As an alternative, Google\u2019s Blogger allows you to publish to a FTP site, which means you can blog from your own domain.  You lose some of the flexibility of the \u2018out of the box\u2019 service, but with a little effort you can have a customized template and pretty easy posting capability that resides within your domain.",
            "As your needs become more advanced or if you are a more technical blogger you may also consider blogging software that can be directly integrated into your website.  One to consider is bBlog.  bBlog is an open source, PHP/MySQL application.  If you don\u2019t know what the last sentence means, then this isn\u2019t for you.  If you do know, then you may benefit from the expanded flexibility an integrated application could provide.",

The blog should reflect the values and objectives of the business as well as be reflective of the overall marketing efforts of the business.",
            "Blogging is relatively straightforward, but to be done correctly does take effort and learning.  There are several blogs dedicated to teaching people the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of blogging.  Be aware that blogs may have themes or be community based so make sure you aware of these before putting your business name out there.  The easiest way, of course, to become familiar with the tone of the blog or social community is to spend time reading posts.",
            "Like any website there are a number of things to keep in mind.  Testing, testing and testing are important to make sure the blog meets business objectives.  The tone of blogs may be more subtle to detect than standard websites, requiring frequent tweaks to get it right.",
            "Be prepared in advance for a much higher level of content posting than normal with a more static website.  Blogs, to be effective, need regular, even daily, infusions of fresh content to stay relevant and keep visitors' attention.",
            "As with a standard website, be aware of legal issues, disclaimers, notifications, copyright issues or other issues relevant to the business.  The informal nature of blogs, as well as the higher volume of updates can create compliance issues if not carefully monitored.",
            "Finally, once a business decides to invest in blogging, there are great ways to spread the word about the new blog.  To get the best marketing results, it is essential to actively promote your business blogs through blog search sites and directories. Promotion and submissions should be consistent with your products, services or the theme of the blog to be most effective.  Adding exclusive or member's only information can also increase the likelihood that casual browsers will invest the time to follow the business' postings.",
            "Promotion of the blog can be almost automatic be creating and promoting Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds in conjunction with the blogs.  Individuals and other, related, websites can view and display blog postings directly from their own websites or personal news readers.  This allows the blog poster to essentially push posts to reader's desktops instead of relying on them to visit the originating blog site.",
            "Since search engine placement is essential for traffic volume the blog should make effective use of keyword phrases.  Blogs are by definition very content heavy website, which afford amble opportunity to generate keyword rich copy. Keywords should be selected to ensure that relevant traffic is directed to the business blog.",
            "In summary, a blog is a great way to promote a business.  A number of advantages can be gained as long as the business plans well and takes the steps to properly promote its new blog.",

            "Introduction - What is a Blog?",
            "Basically, a blog (WeB LOG) is an online diary. There are millions and millions out there! The trick is finding the ones that have information you need and flagging them when they post updates. Advantage: you get the \u2018inside scoop\u2019 before most people in your industry. The good news about blogs is that are probably dozens you will find interesting, the bad news is that means there are dozens of bookmarks you must keep, and since bloggers don\u2019t post on a regular schedule you never know when you need to check back to read updates. That\u2019s why you need a \u201cblog reader\u201d. Technically it\u2019s known as an \u201cRSS Reader\u201d.",
            "So Why Read Blogs?",
            "There are as many reasons to read blogs as there are people. Each person's reasons are different. Here are a few reasons I read blogs:",
            "1. I get a direct line into the thinking of important people in the field. In technology this could be Jonathan Schwartz (Sun) or Irving Wladawsky-Berger (IBM). In the media it might be Dan Gillmor (San Jose Mercury News). Or perhaps it\u2019s people with their finger on the culture like Craig Newmark (craigslist). It's unfiltered and in their own words.",
            "2. Reading from a news aggregator is a much quicker way of reading news. For example, when I log in in the morning and hop over to Bloglines, in one interface I can see what many people are commenting on, along with news outlets like the NY Times, Washington Post, and Boston Globe. This beats visiting the websites individually to see if they might have some updated content to read.",
            "3. You get a much better picture of the individuals involved; what they're working on, what their concerns are, sometimes even what their favorite restaurant is. Most bloggers like to read Comments you can leave. This is a great way to build relationships. It\u2019s not a replacement for personal interaction, of course, but one that has its place and has a lot more scale to it.",
            "4. Announcements are often made first in blogs.",
            "What is an RSS Reader?",
            "RSS stands for \u2018Really Simple Syndication\u2019. Just like your morning paper relies on syndicated news from AP, Reuters etc, so your blog reader will rely on the fact that most blogs \u2019syndicate\u2019 their news - they can \u2018feed\u2019 it to your blog reader for you to review.",
            "A news reader or aggregator checks a list of feeds on your behalf and displays any updated articles that it finds. It is common to find web feeds on nearly all blogs as well as many websites such CNN.com. RSS programs are available for various operating systems.",
            "How do I find an RSS Reader?",
            "Simple - Google \u2018RSS Reader\u2019. The most popular are Newsgator, Google Reader, Rocket. I use Bloglines. The rest of this guide is customized for Bloglines, but the same principals will work for all of them.",

            "[3] In the second browser window, go to http://www.bloglines.com and choose Subscribe - it\u2019s free.",
            "The next bit is tricky, but stay with me:",
            "[4] In browser where you have Bloglines, Under \u2018My Feeds\u2019 choose \u2018Add\u2019 find where it says \u2018Blog or feed URL\u2019",
            "[5] Go back to my blog in the other window, look down the right column until you see where it says \u2018Subscribe me\u2019 and underneath you\u2019ll see a line that says \u2018RSS XHTML CSS 508&#8242;. Now, RIGHT CLICK on RSS and choose \u2018Copy Shortcut\u2019 and then go to the bloglines window and Paste this into the space where it says \u2018Blog feed or URL\u2019. If you\u2019ve done it right, this should go into the window:",

            "[7] Result - You now have a \u2018feed\u2019 to my blog and whenever I post an update it\u2019ll show up in Bloglines and you\u2019ll see it. OK?",
            "[8] Now you can look at some other blogs you might like to add in Bloglines. This is how you keep your eyes on multiple sources of blog info without having to go fetch it from each website in turn. You just have to find the RSS or XML (same thing) button on each blog. Usually you\u2019ll find this button on the left or right column. It might have a graphic that says \u2018XML\u2019 or \u2018RSS\u2019. You just bookmark Bloglines.com. It\u2019s your one stop shop on the internet for dozens of sources of information on your topic. How cool is that!",
            "How to find Blogs that interest you:",
            "[9] Start by searching in Bloglines where it says \u2018Search all Blogs\u2019 at the top of the page. Once the blog shows in Bloglines click on the title to go to the actual blog and find the RSS button. Then repeat steps [4] - [7] above to add it to Bloglines. If you have different topic areas then I suggest you use the option [Create Folders] to organize the blogs under different headings. You don\u2019t need to just read blogs on your speaking topic, there\u2019s blogs on every topic out there.",

            "- Google -> More -> Blog Search",
            "- http://www.technorati.com -> Search",
            "[11] The single best place to find quality blogs is to check out the sidebar on any blog that interests you for blogs that author recommends. It\u2019s usually listed as a \u2018Blogroll\u2019. Look down the right side of my blog and you\u2019ll see a half-dozen on speechwriting and PR. Cilick and check out any that interest.",
            "[12] Final tip. You can search Google News on your Topic. Guess what? You can grab this as a feed as well! Look to the right side and do the right-click thing where it says \u2018RSS\u2019 and add it as a feed to Bloglines. Hint: If you are searching for all the news on the topic \u201cNational Speakers Association\u201d be sure to put it in quotes before you Google, or you\u2019ll get separate news on each word, not the phrase. This also works if you search on Blogs using Google.",

Blogging can help target readers who are interested in a company\u2019s product or service and businesses can keep track of what their readers are looking for through blogging. In addition, blogging can help link together companies that compliment each other very easily.",
            "There is a lot of talk about blogging. Some feel that blogging is just a passing fad, but others feel it is just the beginning. Some business analysts feel that blogging does not significantly help a business market the company. Many businesses feel that this is not so. Blogging can be a beneficial way to mark a business, build an audience and help link in other companies together.",
            "Blogging can help almost any business expose their readers to their services and products. Sometimes with new products, a blog can create interest in something new. Blogging is helpful because it can talk in depth about the product, and it can also give step-by-step instructions on how a certain product can be used. A reader, who is interested in the product after reading about it on a blog, will be more inclined to research similar products on the Internet. This can lead to a more informed consumer and can save a consumer time when shopping or researching a new product. In turn, a company may save time because customers who have read the blog are already informed about the product. These customers can also read reviews on these products and services, which can be helpful in the buying process.",
            "Another great thing about companies using a blog for their products and services is that a blog enables the company and the customer to communicate effectively. A customer can read the blog and comment on it right away. This provides good feedback to the company and they can know what the customers want. Usually blogs will provide places for readers to leave their comments or send emails to the writer. This is a good marketing tool for businesses. People enjoy communicating about products and services that they have had good or bad experiences with and blogging provided the opportunity to do so.",
            "Blogs can also help market a business because it will be included in search engines. When people enter certain keywords, blogs that contain those words will show up. When blogs are updated frequently, search engines can provide your company with a lot of hits. This can lead to many people looking at the company\u2019s blog who might not otherwise have done so.",
            "When companies use blogs, it also has the ability to create a sensation around a product and influence public opinion. This is an excellent tool for companies to use. Because of the huge popularity of blogging, this can be a more effective tool than some forms of advertising. Readers are more likely to share interesting blogs with their friends and this can help companies get the word out about their product.",
            "Another way blogging can help market a business is that blogs often help a company position itself as a leader in a certain field. This means that those who blog can show their expertise about certain subjects and then updates this information on a regular basis. Blogging can help generate leads and send a positive message about your company without spending a lot of money for advertising. Readers can look at these blogs and know that they are dealing with a quality company.",
            "Companies also use blogs to help network with other companies that compliment their business. This is beneficial because they can easily share their links and readers will see all of the blogs that relate to what they are searching for on the Internet. Link swapping is often used in blogging, especially with businesses.",
            "Blogging is proving to be a beneficial marketing tool for businesses all over the world. While it\u2019s a fairly new way for companies and customers to communicate with each other, blogging provides an immediate and unique form of advertising for the company. Customers are able to read and research products and services through blogging and companies can better understand what their customers want."

While not most people would appreciate it, this form of activity makes a person expand his knowledge and entertain new insights coming from current events, personal interaction and actual experiences. Most people of today will not waste their time reading what a person blogs or writes but for sure many would be surprised at how informative such composed blogs contain and how people can be able to express their grief or joy from everyday endeavors.",
            "As I have said before, blogging is a therapeutic form of rehabilitation. It allows a sigh of relief in most cases, allowing people to get a load of their shoulders. Blogging has been limited to people who are Internet exposed people, most of which are the yuppies of tomorrow. Some professionals, particularly in the great areas of the United States and Europe have taken this up and most of them have two things on their mind: for personal distinction (fame) or as another source of income (fortune).",
            "Many have claimed that people are earning millions by the day from blogging alone. Some are just in it to gain the exposure they are longing for, something that they fail to achieve in the competitive world of today, particularly in journalism and article writing tasks. It is not hard to distinguish which blogs or compositions are authentic and the purpose of which is to spread information and become sources for future people who blog. It is the content, hence why people say \u201cContent is King\u201d. If it is just money for the sake of placing keywords in a particular article, then writers and bloggers may as well be given a negative attention towards people who search the web for quality written content or blogs. This is a rarity today, the reason being, all they want is to attract people to visit their sites and raise their page ranks as analyzed by Google which will raise the stakes for possible pay per click advertisements. This gives article and content writing a bad name. It deprives the people who really pour out their heart and minds towards sharing towards people what their opinions really are. Blogging should not be treated solely for making money, it should be about a person\u2019s viewpoint, something that is surely different from that of others.",
            "For fame itself, people who love to read what a person writes is more than enough to give due recognition to the author. Quality should never be sacrificed for keyword density as they say. It is not easy to spot a poorly written article. Repetitiveness of words, and totally out of sync compositions are the immediate noticeable marks. So the next time you see such things, expect the blog or composition to be full of non-sense and just go back to the previous page and look for that quality written composition that is worth the time reading. Besides, everyone values their time, hence make good use of it and spot the low quality content right away."

            "For starters, what is a blog? In general terms, it is a sort of interactive, regularly updated online journal. A blog owner is called a blogger, the activity of keeping a blog is called blogging, and the blogging community and everything related to blogging is collectively known as the blogosphere.",
            "How are blogs created? There are several options. The cost-free way is to start a blog at one of the countless free blog services, such as the Google service called blogger. Another option is to use one of the free blog scripts and install it at a paid or free hosting service. Such free blog scripts are also numerous, the most popular of them being wordpress. It is also possible to sign up for a paid hosting service with an already installed wordpress blog, but this service is somewhat costlier.",
            "Now let's assume that we already have a blog. The next question is: Where do we get content? Choose the subject for your blog. It may be your professional occupation or hobby. In any case, you must have solid knowledge of the subject. For instance, if you are a proctologist, you may write about hemorrhoids, their treatment, prevention and suchlike as long as these are not scientific articles, but materials written in layman's language. To give you a more practical example, if your hobby is dogs, write about them and people will enjoy it. There is another way to get content. The web has many services offering free articles. All you have to do is select the most interesting ones and publish them. In this way you can quickly fill your blog with content.",
            "Moving on to the question of promoting your blog, it is worth noting that blogs are better indexed by search engines than ordinary web sites due to the specifics of the algorithm used in blogs. For instance, a new article in a well-promoted blog may appear on the search engine results page already on the following day. Of course, this requires registration in special catalogs devoted to blogs, which is what you will do next. Another way is to publish articles with a link to your blog. There are also services meant for just this purpose.",
            "But most importantly, a search engine needs external links to your blog from other web sites. These should be good links generating heavy traffic. What does it mean? It means that ideally the link should be on the web site's main page. What's more, this page should have a PR rating of at least 4 (PR or Google Page Rank reflects the significance of any particular web page). Five or six such links will do more than hundreds of other ordinary links. How can you get such links? There are also various options. For instance, you can find a resource thematically related to your blog and offer its owners to reciprocate links. Finally, you can buy such links. The higher the web site's PR rating, the more such links will cost you.",
            "Now let's move on to the question of how you can earn money from your own blog. The scheme is quite simple: traffic is converted into money. Your income increases proportionately with the traffic volume. One way to earn from a blog is to place ads, which is done most often through google adwords. Another way is to participate in partnership programs associated with the subject of your blog. So if your blog is devoted to dogs, you should advertise flea control products and other dog-related merchandise. A third way is to sell your own merchandise or services. Of course, you can combine several ways of generating income in a single blog. Last but not least, remember that strength is in numbers, which is why it's a good idea to maintain several resources at the same time."

The blogging movement is very much about individuality, so it makes plenty of sense that there would be many different platforms available that are designed to meet the needs of different kinds of individuals undertaking different kinds of projects. This diversity is a good thing, because it means that you will almost certainly be able to find a program that suits your level of technical aptitude.",
            "However, the fact that no two bloggers need the same thing from a blogging platform can make your search for the right platform a bit tricky. When you are reading reviews of different platforms, try to keep your priorities in mind and do your best to take into account the position that the reviewer is coming from. For example, a negative review written by an accomplished software designer who complains that a popular platform is too limited may tell you that the platform in question is ideal for a beginning blogger. There is no such thing as the perfect platform for everybody, so instead of looking for the \"best\" platform, look for the best platform for your specific criteria."

Make sure to start a new blog if you are totally off the main subject of the blog that you are posting to.",
            "Blogger and several other free blog companies make it very simple to have a brand new blog up and running in a matter of a few minutes. Try not to post an article about dogs on a blog about golf. Once you have an interesting blog on one particular topic, the best place to start making money is Google AdSense.  Blogger has made it very simple to add AdSense ads to your blog.",
            "The ads that show up on your blog will be targeted towards the topic of your blog, which means if you have a blog about dogs, the ads that show up on your blog will deal with pets. It's like Google is paying you to advertise on your blog.",
            "Another way to make money with your blog is with affiliate programs.  Companies will pay you good money to  advertise their products, and all you have to do is put a link or banner on your blog leading to that companies web site. Once a sale is made the company gives you a commission. That is the reason you should pick one topic for your blog.  If you want to have a blog about your life, by all means do it, but have other blogs about specific topics if you want to make money.",
            "Once you find a topic that interest you, look for affiliate programs for that particular topic.  With the dog blog example, there are several dog training products that you can have links and banners to on a dog blog that will make good money. ClickBank is the top company when it comes to affiliate products, they have over 10,000 products to choose from.  Browse their products to see which ones you would like to promote. Obviously you want to pick something that fits the topic of your blog, but don't limit yourself to just one, you can change a product you are promoting with a few clicks.",
            "The internet is the essence of marketing, by that I mean, every word in an ad matters, every color, where the ad is located on your blog, whether is is blinking or not, and the color of the text.  It might not seem like all of those things matter, but the fact is, everything that you decide matters.  The good thing is you can experiment with how your blog looks as much as you want.  There are several e-books written on how you should place and where you should place them, in the beginning, just go with the basic blog set-up until you get the hang of things."

            "I use a 10 step guide to setting up and starting all of my blogs.",
            "I will give you a list of the top 10 resources later that I use and recommend to everyone who is serious about making lots of money online. One of the vital aspects people seem to miss out when they first get into blogging is the fact that their blog must contain information that people want to read.",
            "Many bloggers are looking through closed eyes in this regard and if you browse through 50 blogs you will notice that most will tell you they know How to Make Money with Blogs when really all they tell you is where they went on their vacation or how many cars they have.",
            "Are you ready to learn How to Make Money Blogging?",
            "If the answer is YES then read on and start to make money with your blog. I am not here to tell you how to write your blog, that's up to you, but what I am about to tell you is the 10 things I use to make money on the internet. You can choose to use these techniques or not, that's your prerogative.",
            "Step 1 - Finding a Topic",
            "Turn off your computer, grab a pen and some paper and sit somewhere you can relax but also stay focused (if you are just starting out this step can be a pain because we all want to know How to Make Money Online and we want to know how to make it NOW). Think of a topic you are interested in and write it down (this helps because you will be more committed to trying instead of giving up in a day or two) and also make sure it is something other people are interested in too. A couple of ways I use to think of a topic is by using MetaSpy to find out what people are searching for, Ask IQ to find what's popular and VRE Toolbar to find out how many people search for the topic (this is also useful later on to get traffic). Write down your top five keywords, you will want to use them later in your blog.",
            "Step 2 - Create Your Blog",
            "Find and create your blog online. I like to use Blogger but other popular Blog platforms are Wordpress and Movable Type. You can find all the help in the program you use to get information when setting up the blog. Create your content, make it original, and make it informative. This is one of the main keys to learn How to Make Money with Blogs. You need to include the keywords you wrote down in Step 1 in the content of your blog. Try not to overuse these as it sends out bad signals to the search engines, and this is 100% not what you want.",
            "Step 3 - Go Google",
            "Sign up for Google Adsense and insert the code in the margin of your blog. You can customize your ads in many ways, such as including text links or image links. I prefer the text links only, as they are easier to blend in with your blog and don't take the focus away from the information. Google Adsense will probably not make you a millionaire but it is an instant way of generating a small amount of money.",
            "If you want to track where your visitors are coming from with regards to direct hits or from search engine results then I would suggest you use Google Analytics and again you can get all the help you need setting that up from within the program.",
            "You will also want to add your URL to Google's index.",
            "Step 4 - Find Something to Sell",
            "If you don't want to sell anything and are happy with the income Google Adsense is bringing in then you can skip this step. If you want to maximize your income and truly learn How to Make Money with Blogs you will want to find an affiliate program to join. A couple of affiliate programs I would suggest are ClickBank and Commission Junction. You can sell anything from office furniture, pet supplies, movies and clothing to PC games, Dieting tips and Audio software.",
            "Whatever program you join will give you help inserting the code you will need to insert into your blog, but be sure you do this correctly or you WILL NOT earn money from your visitors. If you do not know how to edit HTML, W3Schools HTML tutorial is a great place to start.",
            "Step 5 - Social Bookmarking",
            "There is no better advertising than word of mouth, but the next best thing is social bookmarking. You will want to make things easier for people to do this. Social bookmarking sites I use and recommend are OnlyWire and SocialMarker and they are used for people to share their bookmarks or websites that they have liked with other people in their online community.",
            "I would not suggest you add your own links to these services, but provide visitors to your website the ability to do so.",
            "Step 6 - Write an Article",
            "Whether your blog is about a specific product, for example a certain MP3 Player you are promoting, or just about giving people information, I would suggest you to write an article or a review of it. Most article directories require articles of 500 words and over so I would use this as a rule when writing to ensure your article is published.",
            "Submit your article to any of the 100's which are out there. I personally use a few of the Top Article directories such as EzineArticles, Article Dashboard, Amazines.com, isnare and SearchWarp. I also use a nifty piece of software called Article Submitter which will submit your articles to over 600 article directories, which saves you lots of time and leaves you to focus on writing your blogs.",
            "Step 7 - Ping The Hell Out Of It",
            "Every time you add new information to your blog, you want to let the blog directories know about it, this is known as pinging. Some Blog providers automatically send out pings when you update, but to be on the safe side you will want to do this manually too. ONLY PING WHEN YOU UPDATE.",
            "There are a couple of Ping sites I use which will send a ping to multiple blog directories at the same time. PingMyBlog would be my first port of call and then if for some reason that site is down I would use Ping-o-matic. Remember, to only ping when you update or you could get blacklisted, and that is bad.",
            "Step 8 - Yahoo! Answers and Forums",
            "One of the easiest ways to get targeted visitors to your blog is to make use of the people you want to target. I would suggest you sign up to at LEAST one forum in the topic you are writing about, and don't just go straight in there and start posting comments for people to look at your blog, they won't.",
            "The secret is to add the link to your blog in your signature and actively become a member of the forum, posting relevant topics and starting debates within them. The more you post, the more your link will show, and if you provide someone with good info the chances are higher they will click your link.",
            "Yahoo! Answers is along the same lines as forums but the beauty of this is it's viewed by thousands of visitors each day. If you don't already have a Yahoo! account get one and then login and search for questions relating to the topic of your blog and answer them well. You can then insert the link to your blog and as with the forums, if you answer well you may have not only earned yourself a point or two on Yahoo!, but also earned a visitor to your blog.",
            "Step 9 - Update Your Blog",
            "This can be by several means, one is to add new reviews or content to your blog, and if you are going to do this I suggest updating every couple of days. This helps to keep the search engines happy as they love to see new and original content.",
            "Another way of updating your blog and keeping the content fresh is to add RSS feeds to it. Make sure the feeds are relevant to your blog and provide visitors with helpful information. Visitors to a World of Warcraft blog don't want to read feeds about knitting, or do they?",
            "Step 10 - More, More, More",
            "Repeat steps 1 - 10, this is the only way How to Make Money Blogging.",
            "Step 11 - A Bonus Step",
            "If you have your own product or newsletter, give your visitors an easy way to sign up to receive updates or information. This helps you to contact the visitor again with more great info or products you wish to sell.",
            "How to Make Money Online is easy if you follow the above steps.",
            "Some important things to remember so you don't get disheartened with your blog is the fact that you will not become a millionaire overnight, it takes hard work and a lot of effort. If you are really serious about learning How to Make Money with Blogs then stick with it and eventually you will have an Ah-Ha moment. This is when things start to work and you think to yourself Ah-Ha, that's how they do it. Your moment could be sooner than you think.",

            "5. Writing blogs: There are people who need someone to write and post new material on their blogs regularly. If you have enough time then you can make money by writing for someone else\u2019s blog. And if you have the proper knowledge of SEO then you can make a really cool amount of money doing so.",
            "6. Though I won\u2019t suggest you to take up this kind of earning method but recently I came across a couple of blogs that were actually making money from whatever people donated to them. They were offering eBooks and mp3s for free respectively. And well the option of how much to pay was open for visitors. You could even download stuff without paying even a penny.",
            "7. Retailing: Of late there have been blogs that have been trying to sell merchandise too. You can find on sale objects like t-shirts, pottery, designer glassware and other stuffs like that. Though they have not seen much success, but with more publicity and better software support they are bound to become a huge success.",
            "8. Consultancy: It is quite common for experts to start their own blogs for their own promotion but the trend has nowadays spilled over to bloggers with absolutely no background in consultancy making huge amounts of money by charging their visitors and clients in consulting business. This is more so because of the kind of reputation that they have built with their blogs. Blogs have the kind of power that can make you an expert on a certain topic overnight. Being an expert in a certain field can surely make you an overnight celebrity and quite rich too.",

            "- Make Sure That Each Blog Post\u2019s File Name Are Descriptive. Different blogging software behaves differently, but some will call your blog posts 2.html, 3.html, 4.html, etc. As you can see, that is not very descriptive and not particularly helpful to either people or search engines.

But is it always possible for a blogger to trap its writing potential in every subject or area in which he or she writes. The answer is a big No. Though, as a blogger you might be adept in writing collaterally on two subjects, but it is next to impossible to write with equal impact on all the subjects. The basic intention of writing a blog is to do business and make easy bucks, and this is possible if you deliver well and deliver right.

Increasing keywords in your blogs make it easier for the search engine to deliver just the exact article, as the reader wants to read.   Furthermore, by placing ads in your site, specific to your blogs, will help you generate more profits because when a visitor visits your blogs, they are more likely to click on the link of that advertisement.

You may not always like what they have to say, but their comments alone will help your blog seem more interesting to anyone who reads it. If you want to be sneaky, you can even comment on your blog yourself, using a different name. This can quickly create a controversy that some readers will appeal to. Try being honest and letting the readers comment themselves, but if all else fails, use the sneaky approach to break the ice. Once one person makes a comment, others will be more likely to comment as well. This will help get things going and make your blog a place to bounce ideas off of others.",

This will be seen by readers as an open invitation to respond. Your questions will get them thinking about what you have to say, whether or not they respond. They will be more likely to come back to your blog to read more about your comments later on. Everyone has an opinion on everything, so go ahead and ask your readers straight out what theirs is.",

Get a digital camera if you don\u2019t already own one so you can update your pictures frequently. By adding pictures that go along best with the content of your posts, you will be connecting with your readers on a more intense level. They will be more entertained and you will have a more interesting blog. Just be sure that you don\u2019t overdo it on the pictures. Place them in appropriate places and don\u2019t use massive pictures or else you might take the risk of having a blog that take ten minutes to load. Do be sure that you use close-ups however. You wouldn\u2019t want to use pictures that were impossible to see on the screen.",
            "Be Personal",
            "When writing your posts, you should always act as if you were talking to a great friend. Some people create boring blogs by writing as if they were writing a textbook. This is a huge mistake. People most often read blogs because they want to be entertained or gather interesting information or opinions. They do not want to read a blog that sounds like a textbook. Try to be a little personal in your blog. Let your own personality shine through. Allow your individual humor to be seen in each post. Your readers will appreciate your honesty and love you for your casual style.",

Keep in mind that successful blogs will make people laugh, think, contemplate, and gain useful information. You can do all of this using these tips.

Letting them in on the details of your business will make them feel part of your company culture and increase the chances of their lifetime loyalty.",
            "4. UPDATE FREQUENTLY.",
            "Once you have established a good reader base, offer new insights regularly to reward surfers for coming back. Not only does this provide more information and exposure, but it also reflects that your company is active and on top of things. Link to current articles from other sources to keep readers abreast of developments in your sector. A rarely-updated blog feels stale and tired. This is not the reputation you want your company to have!",
            "5. ADHERE TO COMPANY RULES.",
            "You are personally responsible for whatever material you publish on your company blog. Respect the confidentiality of your organization and employees. Though you may express disagreements or concerns, do not make personal attacks or use the blog to air petty complaints. Do not reveal proprietary information; and avoid discussing revenue, share price, or other financial statistics. Observe copyright law, and quote sources as you would in any other document. Make sure what you write in the company blog reflects the company\u2019s goals. Keep in mind the ultimate goal of most company blogs is to increase visibility and promote the exchange of information. While most companies allow and encourage blogging on company time, you should avoid letting your writing time interfere with your regular workload.",
            "6. WRITE GRAMMATICALLY.",
            "Finally, make sure that what you write is grammatical. Your blog entries reflect your company, and you want to give the best possible impression of the organization and its personnel. The Internet is rife with bad English. Though blogs tend to be relaxed in tone, it is no more appropriate to ignore standard English than it is to wear flip-flops and swimming trunks on casual Friday. Use a program like StyleWriter ( http://www.StyleWriter-USA.com ) or White Smoke ( http://www.WhiteSmokeSoftware.com ) to find and fix embarrassing grammar mistakes and help you write like a pro.",
            "A company blog is an excellent tool for promotion, communication, and information. The tips outlined here will help elevate your blog and generate traffic and interest. Good luck, and welcome to the wonderful world of blogging!",

            "Some people like to read blogs, others like to read newsletters, still others like to rely on feeds and some read a few or all of them. No matter the method the information is distributed, each medium has one thing in common: content. Having a blog connects your newsletter and your business with all of these readers and delivers important content in a particular style.",

When blogs first hit the scene in the late '90s, they were personal diaries and journals. Like the blog business, my blog has transformed from personal to business speak, although I still add personal notes here and there.",
            "A few bloggers tend to talk about their work, their products and their little world. That might work for celebrities where fans want to know everything about them, but it doesn't work for the average business person. Other business people want information on how to succeed and when a blog spends time hawking products offering information of no value, few people will return. The people whose products sell well are the ones who provide valuable information. Readers already know what kind of information they're getting, so they trust that when they buy something, it will be of the same or better quality. This value must be reflected in their blog. It's much like people who only sign up for a newsletter after first seeing an example.",

            "The big decider is whether or not you can write in the blog almost daily. The people behind the high traffic blogs post multiple times a day. Though resourceful, merely linking to other sites doesn't give visitors much reason to make the effort to come to yours. Reading other blogs or feeds is a great way to learn how to carry a discussion. Find other blogs covering topics similar to yours and check them out. Disagree with their opinions? Write about it and explain your reasons. Cross-blog discussions are common, and that's where trackback comes in handy.",

If you decide to comment on another blog posting in your blog instead of in that blog's comments page, then you link to the conversation through the trackback link.

Starting from scratch with little traffic means you have a long road ahead and lots of work to do. There is no magic formula anyone can sell you for $97 to make your blog an overnight success.

In reality, this is too much. What I need to do for my readers is create three separate blog entry points, so those interested in writing, newsletters and Internet marketing get nothing but the wordy entries. Those interested in Web design get the webby stuff and the technophiles receive the geeky content.",

For an explanation of syndication and feed readers, refer to What Is This RSS, XML, RDF, and Atom Business? When sending a new issue of a newsletter, comment on it or link to it in the blog, that way the blog and feed readers will get the goods, so all three bases are covered.",

I use it to manage the list of tableless Web sites. Using blogging tools is much easier than the way I managed it before, updating the HTML files by hand. Though using a blog tool, it isn't a blog. In this case, the blog tool has become a content management system (CMS).",
            "Small business owners don't have a need for the fancy and pricey CMSes out there. They find it easier to use blogging software to manage their sites or hire someone to adapt the tool for their site.",
            "Blogs have found a place in businesses and people are finding creative ways to use them. Some companies have a blog on the intranet for communicating project status, jeopardies and metrics. They're used for knowledge management. With information pouring in, blog tools provide a way to share, organize and process the information.",
            "Being a follower can be good or bad. No one wants to walk off a cliff with the lemmings, but everyone wants to succeed. Best practices won't help, since the decision to blog is based on the organization's mission, needs and goals along with its target market's desires and needs. A blog about lemmings? There is one, sort of. Or maybe you'd like to start your own and talk about dumb business moves."

There are no editorial content and interaction with the readers is easy because of the comment feature. Blogging has emerged here to stay.

Well in this blog he uses words as Alexa trains, technorati trains, link trains, viral link trains etc\u2026which again talks about linking. Well technorati is a term used for a link, it is either linking to one other blog or other site. This is also just an experiment to understand if the linking helps in getting visitors and earns reputation for the blog itself.",

Research is the best thing to understand and know the other Bloggers as well, it is important to establish a rapport or communication so that you are able to learn some things that you do not know in Blogging.",
            "One other thing in Link building is to establish good linking sites and learn from those sites and than may be take permission from the owner of the site for link building, I am sure a polite language can always give you an earning potential in the Blogging industry. There are people who do not have patience, and want to find their way in earning good money but they fail because of the impatience and ignorance in researching more about what they want to do and how they would like to achieve certain things as Bloggers.",
            "Today there are tons of Bloggers who are into the business of Blogging and they are doing pretty good I have to say, but it is just through learning, establishing and link building that you find your way in this business.

There's nothing to stop you from repeating the same process for dozens or even hundreds of different subjects.

Luckily, there are programs available to help you automate the process of creating multiple blogs, and offer detailed help about how to get all the different revenue streams set up and generating income.",

Advertising on TV can be intrusive and produce the exact opposite effects. Viewers often feel as if ideas are imposed on them. The opposite happens with blogging. When done properly, advertising is not intrusive. On the contrary it can be helpful. When done in the form of a review, readers can gain from the information presented and possibly pursue the advertisements or just read a different post.  A reader can always find what they are looking for. For the marketer, the situation is beneficial since, they do not perceived negatively. Readers can also interact; write responses that result in getting desired feedback for their product or service. Bloggers can harness these benefits their blogs can offer and make money doing so.  More and more bloggers are monetizing their blogs by writing reviews. Making money blogging by writing reviews is becoming increasingly popular and profitable for some. A good comprehensive review by an established blogger can cost thousands of dollars and for the advertiser it can be what makes or breaks his campaign. Every marketer should at some point consider buying reviews from bloggers. They are great in increasing buzz for the product, driving traffic to a site and a way to build backlinks.

In essence, a blog is a website featuring an easy to use content management system that allows for quick updating in chronological order.  The roots of blogging trace back to online journaling and community-building efforts, but approached from a business perspective, blogs are uniquely positioned to make you money.

In the end, effective blog use produces high search engine rankings and, thus, great traffic levels.  Traffic, of course, is a key to profitability.

The result is empowering.  Instead of dreading content updates, webmasters can actually look forward to adding new material in moments.  Whether a blog user writes their own content or outsources the job to a pro, adding the new text is a simple and convenient proposition.  This makes it easy to build the content-rich sites that soar to the top of the search engine rankings.  It also creates a heightened level of stickiness for the blog, making return visitors far more likely.  That traffic, when coupled with the right moneymaking strategy produces impressive results.",

            "The object is to have a niche and to keep everything small; if you are looking for range of view or balance you will find yourself lost in the shuffle. The general premise of a blog is to sell an idea, anyone who makes blogs are not merely asking for money because of the blog itself, the ideas are the star of the show and the blog is merely the vessel to transport it to the clients. It is one of the best ways to gain reputation in business networking, this in turn leads to more business and finally to what you have been striving for which is profit. They are kind of like a tool that you need to transport information in short bursts, as to not confuse or overwhelm the customer. By keeping them short, many business people believe that the original message or core idea remains intact. There is thought amongst the net industry that far more intangible ideas and products are being peddled online these days, this in turn decreases paid content value, rerouting the connection between the business and the client is the primary goal.",
            "One of the best methods to date, to generate business and profit is to employ a good blogger. Bloggers have a way of gaining trust; they also can capture the market with the use of strategic reputation. Microsoft is one of the leading employers of the blogging trend, and uses the blogs on all their sites and sales pitches. Microsoft feels that if they have multiple blogs that give small portions of information and tid-bits, of needed content they can reach a broader market and keep people informed on what they are doing in the business and any market adjustments that may come your way. If more companies go this route, you could easily see a change in the face of business. Faster communication between client and company, more precise information packets that are not stressing to understand, and an overall cleaner appearance are the goal with the blogging industry. These little vessels of information just may be here to stay.",

If you are treating your blog as a personal diary, your posts may be a little longer than normal. But, if you are trying to get more traffic to your blog, then you really want to focus the attention with short posts that offer the main point easily. Most blog readers will only scan your posts, not read them word for word. So keep this in mind when you are writing. The shorter the post, the more likely they are to read the entire thing. If your blog is easy to scan because the posts are short and the breaks are clear, you will have a great looking blog.",

Blue and black are easy to see, so they are always great choices to use. Sea-green, beige, or purple are also great soothing colors to use for a blog. You should stay away from using colors like pink, yellow, or any neon varieties. They are extremely hard on the eyes when reading them online and can deter people from reading your blog. Keep these color tips in mind when you design your blog to get the best results available.",

With most blogging software offering ways to easily add pictures, it should not be a problem for most publishers to add them right into the blog. If you do have trouble, consider checking the \u201chelp\u201d area in your blogging software for more information. The information there should provide you with step by step instructions to help you get on your way.",

The layout should be clear and defined. If the reader is confused by the layout, they will likely not stick around to explore. They will most likely go right on to the next blog available. If you are letting a professional design your blog, you will likely not need to worry much about the layout. However, if you are doing it yourself, take a look at other successful sites to get ideas about what works and what doesn\u2019t. Look at your site like a reader would to get the best advice you can. Lastly, simply test different layouts on your friends and family to see which ones they find the most suitable for your blog."

Blogs are good for non-bloggers too, letting people on the other side of an issue, or a war, or the planet, read about what life is like on your side. A few years ago I met a woman with a terrible secret which sounded like some insane conspiracy theory.

Instead, she is having two guest bloggers fill in. Isn\u2019t a guest blogger like putting two chapters of someone else\u2019s autobiography in the middle of your own? I assume that the guest bloggers will give a window into THEIR own lives, and I suspect, they\u2019ve already proven themselves to her in their own blogs, so her \u2018readers\u2019 could simply read their blogs for two weeks.

Plus, any of the strangers reading your blog might notice something wrong that you aren\u2019t aware of. A medical student might tell you what the tingling in the soles of your feet might mean so that you can consult a doctor before it gets more serious. A German housewife might notice that alcohol features more and more in your life, or that you seem to be shifting between joy and sorrow with worrying regularity. More than a window on someone\u2019s life or simple entertainment, blogs are another way to connect with both friends and strangers, anywhere, anytime."

They can either adopt the age old system of maintaining a personal journal or diary where they write about their daily lives and also poetry or prose, depending on their interest. Another is making use of internet technology and creating a blog to put down their writings. Technology has advanced to a point where all one needs to do is create an account, a username and password and the doors to the wide world are open. Bloggers across the world also have the liberty to share and let their work be read by others. If there are a group of people who are into similar writing they might even get together and write on a single blog where they all have unlimited access. And one can also use the text link exchange option incase there are other blogs he frequents. Those who are interested in advertising their websites can avail a premium membership where they will be expected to pay a nominal amount every month or year.",

There are a number of companies coming up with sites to promote business ventures, news about businesses, any seminars or events happening in the same arena. The traffic on such sites will be people from the industry or those looking for more information on how to enhance their business ventures. These are sites where you become a member, and can share, exchange and get information from. The content is monitored regularly and so are the kinds of people visiting the sites. Since they mean business, they do not encourage random visitors or offensive languages, and adult content. At the end of the day, there must be something that you gain by being part of the site.",

Logically, in progression this should come much later, but because there seems such misunderstandings about Technorati, Del.icio.us and other tagging systems, it may be a good place to put this down.",
            "These articles began because of a thread at Absolute Write called \"What Is Your Technorati Rank?\" On perusing that thread I realized that many writers were placing their hopes in something that just was not going to happen. More so, they were actually misreading the importance of certain \"rankings\" and thus ignoring the more important factors.",
            "If you read the previous articles in this series you now hopefully understand <B>\"keyword basics\"</B>. So we are going to use Technorati for our example.",
            "So along comes techie #1 and says:",
            "\"Hey, you know what. Blogs are becoming mainstay business. They are great for people with no knowledge of HTML and you can literally put up a web-site Weblog in minutes. So now they are multiplying over the net faster than rabbits, and the Search Engines are ignoring them for the most part as most of them contain personal musings and ramblings. So why not create a sophisticated search engine for blogs?\"",
            "\"Great idea,\" says techie #2, \"a search engine from blogs. And that means anyone who has a blog will want to register with us. But how are we going to build it. Obviously, normative search engine technology is not what we want.\"",
            "\"You know what?\" says techie #1 \"we are going to take keywords, call them by a different name and create a closed system!\"",
            "And thus Technorati was born.",
            "What essentially goes on in Technorati, is you define what you write with \"tags\", Technorati tags. These are keywords, (with a special HTML parameter). Keywords just like you will learn to use in your meta tags. Technorati then in a CLOSED SYSTEM connects all the blogs with the same keywords. Technorati does not look at content to a great extent (to my knowledge), <B>they pay attention to the tags re: keywords that you input</B>. If you do not input keywords they use your keywords in your Blog setup.",
            "Okay this is great for all those people looking for blogs say about hairdressing. So they come to Mr. & Mrs. Hair's blog because the Hair couple input keywords as Technorati tags. Simple.",
            "Technorati now goes one step further. Technorati rates your blog based upon a few parameters. One of those \"important\" parameters is how many other people in the Technorati Network (<B>Only those IN the network, or those using Technorati tags</B>) have linked to your blog or a post on it. So by gaining links (there is no concept on Technorati as \"bleeding links\" as far as I know), you move up in the ladder. But even Technorati also keeps track of how popular your blog is. You can have 200 links into your blog, but if no one visits then your standing will not go up to the top 100.",
            "Okay, that is Technorati. Important for bloggers? Well it is a popular site, and growing. So the answer would be yes. Important for Google, MSN and Yahoo --- not on its own...yet there is one critical Caveat.",
            "When someone links to your site in a blog or web site, the href HTML links are in the code. The Search Engines when they read the code with their bots (see how much web lingo you know already!) sees these links. Those get added to the amount of sites linking to you. They are \"hot links\" or \"back links\" into your blog or posts in your blog. So linking not only works in the closed world of Technorati tags, but also works in the Wide World of Search Engine placement. Those links are important. Now if you get linked in a very popular blog, that counts for a lot in the world of Search Engine placement. (As we discussed in the previous articles.)",
            "So while it is nice to know your Technorati ranking is going up, <B>what is IMPORTANT is to remember to use their tools of tagging and linking to get others to discover and link to your blog.</B> That gets noticed by the Search Engines. Not immediately to be sure but if you are being hit a great deal and have links to you, sooner rather than later the Search Engines will pick up your blog and your keywords. They will NOT look at the Technorati tags though, they will look at your meta tag keywords and your content. (Oy Vey! so many things to remember)",
            "Del.icio.us and others work on the same concept, though del.icio.us is more centralized and called a \"social book-marking service\". Just remember the rule of thumb:",
            "<B>The more sites that link to you and your post, no matter for what reason, the better it is for you and your position in the Search Engines.</B>",
            "Okay now what are Categories? Categories really belong in Wiki format, and this is not the scope or place to discuss Wiki and the technology behind it. I own a new Wiki site, and you are welcome to peruse JewishPedia because on a Wiki site you can view all the code to each article.",
            "Categories in blogs (Wordpress implements them automatically) are a way to search for something. I have Categories in my blog,  but this is a code implemented Category Listing in Google's blogger system, where when you click, the blog does a Google Blog search in my blog for all articles related to that word. And thus it depends on Google's specific Blog Search Engine (not their regular search engine).",
            "Remember, Google and others have specific Blog search engines. It is important to be on the top in those as well, BUT for mainstream, if you are using a Blog for whatever reason, <B>your goal is to be in the normative search engines as well, and in a good placement there.</B>",
            "So there you have it. Tags = Keywords. Technorati uses them in the closed world of Technorati. The employ linking counts as well. These keywords and links, if done correctly, are also very useful for Search Engine rankings if your blog is popular. deli.ci.ous uses them for \"social\" blogging.",
            "So don't give up on Technorati. Just don't believe it is the golden answer to be good rankings in the Search Engines. It is but one of the myriad of possibilities.",
            "<I><B>\"The more sites that link to you and your post, no matter for what reason, the better it is for you and your position in the Search Engines.\"</B></I>"

Ping for your blog is indeed a great way to market without really having to do a whole lot. What could be better than sitting around letting a program do your marketing for you?",
            "To understand the concept of ping for your blog, you need to know what the term \u201cping\u201d means. By definition, ping is a computer network tool that is typically used on TCP/IP networks. The Internet is a TCP/IP network, so ping is used on it frequently. Ping works by testing whether a host is operating correctly. It sees if the host can be found on the network of the host that is doing the test. For example, one host will test to see if another host can be found on their network and if the host is working properly. To be more technical, it sends ICMP packets to the host and \u201clistens\u201d for replies.",
            "While the whole concept of \u201cping\u201d can be quite confusing to someone who knows little about networking, you should know how it can affect your blog. Many types of blogging software are automatically set up to ping one or more servers at a time. This typically happens when you create a new posting or when you simply update your blog. Even if you update more than once a day, each time you do, the system will likely ping a few servers. This really means that when you update or post, a signal is sent to a server which then creates a list of the newly updated blogs and you will be included in that signal.",
            "The thing to know when you are a blogger is that when you allow your blog to be a part of this process, you will be getting your blog to a larger audience. What happens is that when your blog is added to that list of newly updated blogs, people will be able to access it more frequently. When someone visits their recently pings page, your site will likely show up with a link to it as well. When there is an index of pinged data, you will likely get even more traffic than normal. In layman\u2019s terms, this means that without any effort on your part, you are gaining more recognition.",
            "When your blogging software does not have the capabilities to ping, you may think that you cannot capitalize on this process. In truth, you can still gain all of the advantages even when your software does not ping. To do this, you will need to visit a site with a pinging service such as Ping-o-matic. It can be used to ping the most popular services available, allowing you the same advantage as every other blogger. The process for using these services is very easy. All you need to do is tell them your blog name and its URL address. It really is that simple. Usually you will provide no other information. You won\u2019t have to supply your name, address, or any other personal information.",
            "Now that you know what ping means and how it affects your blog, you should agree that it is certainly not a bad thing. It can really help your blog get the most exposure out there. The great thing is that you can have all of these advantages without even doing any work. See if your blogging software offers this type of service. If it doesn\u2019t, try visiting a site such as Ping-o-matic to get the most from the ping. Most of the services are free. You might want to be wary of those that charge a fee and are not popular choices. Ignoring this easy marketing tool is a grave mistake. Although you may not personally see a large leap in traffic, it can certainly work for great blogs that have a substantial amount of quality content. Try it for yours to see what it can do for you."

            "Bad blogging habits are easy to get into, and one of the worst is to leave your 'About' page unchanged. You know the page: it is provided by Wordpress as standard and a whole host of bloggers leave it unchanged. Why they do this is known only to them, because this is the first page that a large number of first-time visitors to a blog check out, and the reason why many of them leave without looking further.",
            "All you have to do is to say a little about yourself, who you are, and what your blog is about, why you feel qualified to write a blog about this topic and how you can be contacted. If your blog covers a particular niche, rather than being simply a log of personal comments, then your potential readers will want to know why they should believe what you say by reading your credentials on the subject.",
            "There is nothing wrong with having a personal blog about your personal thoughts on things, but if you are presenting yourself as a form of expert on a specific topic, then you will have to persuade readers that you have a right to do so. You should use your 'About' page to do that.",
            "Another tip you should take is to claim your blog with Technorati. This registers it as yours with Technorati, and you can get a whole load more visitors. Since joining Technorati most of my blogs' traffic rocketed. It takes a while for new blogs to get going, but it's a lot easier if you make use of sites such as Technorati. The same is true of most of the social bookmarking sites if traffic is important to you. If you are using a blog to promote a product, then this is essential.",
            "If you have a website then don't get lazy and be content to run your blog from a hosting site such as wordpress.com. It is better to download the software from wordpress.org, and host your own blog. You have much more control over the look and feel of it, and can use any of the thousands of plugins that are available online. You can also use any template you want, or even design your own. That way you get total customization of your blog pages, and can make it more distinctive than the majority hosted on Wordpress or Blogger's site. If you have tried and had problems downloading and installing it then send me an email. If needed I can take you through it online, or by telephone.",
            "These are the two main tips that any blogger should take if they intend to blog seriously. However, was I to provide the third most important tip for anybody interested in blogging, then it would be to monetize your blog. Don't blog for nothing. If your blog concerns a specific niche subject you can likely throw up one or two affiliate programs on your sidebar so that they appear with your new posts. A three column blog is useful for this, since your regular sidebar will generally be full of permanent links.",
            "If you monetize using Adsense, a three column layout is even more essential, since you will want a vertical block down one of the columns, in addition to some at the bottom and the middle. A good Adsense layout would be a column to the left or right of the main text column containing a vertical ad unit, a horizontal link unit at the bottom of the blog, and also a horizontal ad unit at the bottom of the latest post. You could also include a search box at the top or bottom of your main sidebar that allows a search either on Google, from which you get income, or on your blog.",
            "You could also include one of your websites as a second search option, providing three altogether. The income might not be a lot, but most blogs with a few hundred visitors a day should be able to make from $10 to $20 daily minimum, depending on the niche. All you need are a few blogs like that.",
            "These are my three main blogging tips. Yours would likely be different, since blogging is a very personal thing, but if you take these three on board you will likely find that you will get more visitors, have more fun and also be able to put a bit put aside for the holidays or that unexpected bill that always comes at the wrong time."

            "Because the search engines index blogs very quickly, blogging can be a good way to get your company or product to a wider audience. There are two ways to do this, either closely align your blog with your product, or blog about the market your product serves and reference your product. For the first it makes a deal of sense to include either your company or major product name in the blog title and domain. In fact you could just install a blog in a sub-directory of your main website which would tie it in very closely with your company. Many web hosts now have a domain control panel which enable Wordpress blogs to be installed almost completely automatically. I would suggest Wordpress as suitable blog software as there are an enormous number of add-ons and plugins available to make your blog look and act exactly as you want. A second option would be to register a suitable domain, install Wordpress on it and go from there.",
            "If you want to initially distance yourself from your product, then you might well find it easiest to register a blog with one of the major blog hosts and set yourself up as a special interest blogger. You may wish to do this to attract visitors who might not frequently visit your site but are interested in the markets you serve. If you sell wine for instance you could blog about wine in general and reference the special offers that you sell, maybe including short tasting notes. It might be beneficial to come clean about your association in an About Me page, as being professionally involved in a specific market adds a certain authority to what you write. It would be clear to frequent visitors that you only mention one company but they would have initially been attracted by the content, and would most likely continue to visit as long as the content is valuable to them. The important thing about doing it this way is that your content should hold up regardless of your promotion of your product otherwise you won't get visitors returning.",
            "Blogging for pleasure",
            "If anything this is the most rewarding way to blog. Writing about something you have a passion for is most likely to get visitors who share the same passion and can grow a community as you link to other blogs which have the same focus. I am an Arsenal Football Club supporter and have a blog http://blogs.goonerville.com/blog/LGS_blog.php where I vent and applaud everything about the club and football in general. If you leave the comments turned on, you will get visitors posting their replies to you which can help you gauge reaction to your opinions. But beware, you may not always like what people say about you! It's not compulsory, but you may also be able to make a little money from Adsense or affiliate sales as long as you don't overdo the adverts because you will have a very targeted audience reading the blog.",
            "Whether you are blogging for business or pleasure, the important things to remember are:",
            "1. Write in your own style, don't try and copy anyone else.",
            "2. Use original content. You can use other material, but make sure you are not breaking copyright and add your own content.",
            "3. Pace yourself. Don't start out intending to post every day if you don't have the time and inclination. It is better to start slowly and increase if you can rather than gradually tail off.",
            "4. Use humour if you are humorous. Even if the blog is factual, visitors like to be entertained.",
            "If used well, blogs can be a tremendous aid to communicating whatever message you wish to advance. There are many things you can do to make your blog more accessible and popular, but that are beyond the range of this article and will be covered in future articles."

            "Summary:",
            "Due to the rapid pace of globalisation, the Internet has allowed society to become more interconnected. It has allowed a wider range of contribution from people with varying discourses and ideologies, making this form of media more independent.",
            "Keywords:",
            "Internet",
            "Article Body:",
            "Rapid technological advancements in the 21st Century have ensured that society is now more connected, and there are an increased number of media channels available. Unfortunately, due to dominant media ownerships some would argue that though we have a choice in what we want to watch, our choice is still limited due to tight media control. However, to a limited extent media independence is now being balanced due to the increased popularity of the Internet. This can be clearly illustrated with the level of interaction in chat rooms and blogging. E-mails are being used more frequently, hence influencing the level of communication efficiency. Furthermore, even though advertising companies and people with the technological skill to design and build websites are still dominant in the communication sector, software programs such as Dreamweaver and Microsoft Frontpage provide easy web building packages that enable quick and effective website building for beginners. As a result, media independence is gained with the increasing use of the Internet.",
            "Firstly, Internet and blogging in particular, does not create an age barrier to who can participate. For example, a teenager and a more mature person could have the same opportunity to voice their opinions on the Internet. Also, although it can be argued that the people who do not possess technological skills may be disadvantaged, once the skill is acquired, then people will be able to participate. The author of a webpage or an article has the option of remaining anonymous or writing under a false name, hence, an increase in freedom of speech and a reduction of the risk of being associated with a certain ideology or discourse by a reader. The Internet is promoting greater independence, as minority groups are able to express their views publicly and information can be shared rapidly. There are many benefits to blogging on the Internet. One of the most positive aspects in regards to blogging is that it does not require any technological knowledge, and blogs have the opportunity to be read by people from other cultures and nations.",
            "E-mails have also played a pivotal role in creating media independence. Although e-mails are seen as a form of communication technology, they can also be shared between groups of people. Therefore, increasing the speed of connection and amount of people that will be able to read email has greatly impacted on the sophistication of the Internet and its ability to enhance global communication. E-mails offer instant communication. Rapid communication has led to further enhancement in the exchange of ideas between people, resulting in global networking and increases in international business activities. However, e-mails only benefit those who are literate and those who are able to gain access to the technology. For many citizens in developing countries or the poor in developed countries, the privilege of accessing this tool is not available, hence, although email promotes independence through communication, it also marginalizes those who are unable or cannot afford to use it.",
            "Software packages such as Dreamweaver and Microsoft Frontpage are designed to assist beginners and those who enjoy using the programs. For example, the program Dreamweaver has basic instructions that show the customer how to design a webpage. The program teaches beginners by using terms that are non-jargon coupled with simple instructions. Similarly, Microsoft Frontpage is also an easy-to-use computer software program that takes advantage of its easy-to-manipulate templates and lack of html usage. This encourages first-time users to explore and develop their technical skills.",
            "In conclusion, due to the rapid pace of globalisation, the Internet has allowed society to become more interconnected. Although the Internet does marginalise those who cannot afford or do not have the skill to use it, services such as web hosting companies and easy-to-use software programs are available. The Internet is constantly changing. It has allowed a wider range of contribution from people with varying discourses and ideologies, making this form of media more independent."

Although it sounds daunting the math does work out in the long run in your favour.  This is definitely an avenue even we at OpinView haven't quite fully explored.  Of course, you can always write your own content.

Not only are they good sources of information but are good sources of up-to-date information at that.",
            "People looking for an alternative source of information will find that blogs can sometimes offer a more in depth view or a refreshing take on current events. One of the major benefits of information from blogs, specially from personal, cultural and political bogs, is that it gives readers insight on the locals\u2019 viewpoint. For example, although news sites can offer accurate information and report facts and statistics about important events such as the 9/11 attack or the latest Tsunami tragedy that hit Asia, personal blogs of people who were actually there or knew someone involved in the tragedies offer a deeper and more compelling insight on the events. Reading political blogs would also give you a chance to know what ordinary citizens of a country really think.",
            "The downside with information from blogs is accuracy. Since most blogs are subjective, information garnered from the blogs can be lopsided and even exaggerated. Most blogs do write about facts but give commentaries as well.

            "Before you begin blogging, carefully consider what you are going to write about in your blog as there are lots of interesting topics out there, waiting to be discussed.  You can find them in every day life, in the media, in the news - anything that attracts attention and a loyal following is good. You can look for blog subjects in many places, the most important being the Internet of course.",
            "Put quality content in your blog.  If you have quality content people like to read, they will return to your blog and tell other people about it as well. Posting articles containing useful information on your blog is very beneficial for attracting more traffic. Make sure you add your URL address below your posted article! If other web site owners find your articles useful and decide to include them within the content of their web pages, the added link will contribute to increasing your popularity every time it is hyperlinked.",
            "Update the blog on a regular basis.  If you don't do this, visitors will not return and they will move on to reading another blog that is updated more often. You should try to update your blog daily. Many newcomers have blogging fear, fearing their inability to update it daily.  If your blog is interesting enough, offer your readers the ability to keep it updated by posting their own personal thoughts and share stories so you won't have to do all the updating work yourself.",
            "Listen to what your readers have to say.  Always pay attention to the readers' suggestions and try to find out what people were actually searching for when they found your blog. Try to focus on that theme and even consider developing it by encouraging the visitors to discuss new aspects of that particular theme.",
            "Keep it short and concise - You don't need material that takes hours to read, people usually like to quickly skim a blog for quick tidbits of useful information and if you post materials that are difficult or take a long time to read, you will most likely drive them away.",
            "You can also include some artistic work or pictures in the blog, to make it more visually appealing.  Blog picture managers such as Picasa are freely available on the Internet to accomplish this.",
            "If your blog has interesting, original content, bloggers might decide to add links to it on their web sites and comment on your suggested topic. By gaining back-links to your blog from other web sites, your web site will place higher within search engine queries, thus boosting your link popularity.",
            "Announce the launch of any new blog with press releases.  Free publicity through press releases are powerful tools for increasing incoming traffic.  Search engines love press releases and it gives them a good reason to spider and to index your site quickly.",
            "Include free downloadable viral reports on your blog to turbo-charge visitor traffic and build a subscriber/viewer base quickly.",
            "In order to simplify the creating and updating process of a blog, take advantage of the many blogging tools and software readily available, a number of them are free.  Blogging software such as WordPress or Movable Type helps you update a blog easily.  There are even free blog generators such as Blogger which allow you to host your content on Google\u2019s servers without having to install any software or obtain a domain and host content.",
            "Offer to inform readers of your blog with free email management services like Feedblitz (if you don\u2019t have an email list management solution) in addition to offering RSS feeds for subscription.  Readers and visitors can be kept updated of any new information being added to your blog without having to check the site constantly.",
            "Utilize blog and ping to get sites indexed quickly by the search engines.  By notifying popular ping servers monitored by blog search services such as Google Blog Search, you attract search engine spiders to a blog.  A blog can automatically be setup to ping certain web sites.  An easy method of doing this is by adding the Pingomatic service to the sites to ping in the blog software which pings many popular ping servers at once.",
            "Finally, remember to submit to popular, high quality blog directories such as Feedster, Technorati, Blogstreet, and Best of the Web Blog Directory to boost your web traffic and link popularity!",
            "If you respect these rules you will most likely have a successful blog, and you will be rewarded in the process. Ask a SEO consultant for further information and assistance if you are stuck for ideas to promote your new blog."

            "1. A blog on the same domain name, (as part of your website like yourdomainname.com/blog) can help you add fresh content to your website without having to know html. Fresh daily or even weekly content can keep the search spiders coming back more often. Writing your blog posts on the topics or search terms you want to be relevant for helps as well. Each blog post becomes another webpage targeted for your keywords.",

A Blog on the same domain name or on a subdomain of your domain name or even one that is on another domain name can help you reach out to potential and existing customers with special offers, information, surveys, and more. You can add sales offers on the fly without having to call your web designer to add it for you.",
            "4. A blog on a subdomain like blog.yourname.com is another way to go. Subdomains in most cases are treated as a separate domain name, yet can bring yourname.com more traffic as well. Here link popularity also kicks in a little. You of course link to yourname.com from blog.yourname.com but you can also trade links with other blogs but have them link to yourname.com instead of blog.yourname.com. Those links will be treated as one-way-inbound-links and that helps your page rank, but also brings you more traffic.",
            "5. A blog on it\u2019s own domain name can do that as well, but the link from it to yourname.com is going to carry more weight.",
            "6. Getting the spiders to find all of your new websites. I find that because I have several blogs, if I want to get my or a client\u2019s new website crawled by the search engines I can do it faster by adding a link to my blogs than I can by submitting to the search engines. Because I update my blogs daily, the spider crawls the blog a lot and follows the links there. I have seen this work for getting a website crawled within 3 days. This only works for a blog that has been regularly updated for awhile. (around 6 months or more).",

What I haven\u2019t mentioned is that by building up a steady readership on a blog, you will gain a lot of new customers. They get to know you and trust you by reading your blog every day.",

Some choose to use a blog more like a personal diary, while other people want to get as many readers on their site as possible. One easy way to increase traffic on your blog site is to link swap. Link swapping is fairly simple and only requires that you have an agreement with other bloggers or websites to put your link on their site in exchange for the same from them. Link swapping is a perfect way to help increase the readership on your blog.",

Some companies may opt for a more professional blog site and hire web designers for this type of job.",

            "1. <b>You must have content</b> - words, phrases, information - on your web site.",
            "2. <b>You should have \"original\" content on your web site.</b> This is content which either you have created or have gotten permission to reproduce on your web site. It should be \"original\". Copying content from a web site, and putting it in your blog, where that content has been reproduced in thousands of other web-sites, is not going to help your Google ranking (and you may even be penalized for it.) This does NOT mean that everything, every single phrase and post and article you put up on the web has to be original and not repeated elsewhere. What it does mean though, is that the majority of your web site or blog should be just that - YOURS.",
            "3. <b>Your content should constantly grow.</b> You should be adding to it on a daily or bi-daily basis. Stagnant blogs and web sites are noticed for being stagnant - dead. They drop so fast in Search Engine (search engine) rankings you have no clue! Web sites demand nurturing and work. They do NOT run on auto mode. (Just look at how much time you spend with your blog!)",
            "<b>Now as to why and how.</b>",
            "Search Engines look for content. They have developed very sophisticated algorithms to check content. To see if this content is original, or they are coming across the millionth time they have seen the same thing. This is all mathematical btw. And this is NOT the only thing they look that. (We will get to those other things in our next posts). However, <b>Content is critical</b>. Lets give two examples.",
            "1. Ever notice how fast some popular Forums get indexed in the Search Engines. This is due to the fact that they have an incredible amount of page hits, and that they exist for POSTS. Posts on forums are <b>ORIGINAL</b> for the most part. So engines look for the Content, forums have this, they list them, they see original content - the forum moves up the list, and thus more people find the forum in the search, more people hit the forum pages, more \"hits\" and \"eyeballs\" are registered back on the Search Engine servers, and the forum keeps on moving up. The more hits - by mathematics - the more posts. The more posts the more original content. The more original content the better the listing. The better the listing - the more people find the forum. Getting the picture? A never-ending circle of success.",
            "2. For those of you in doubt as to whether Search Engines can \"read\" content just take a look at Adsense and Adwords. When you go to a site with them, adverts are fed out based upon the: 1: Content of the page you are on, and 2) Your IP address to determine which country and language you speak. Since I am in Israel, I am never surprised if I hit a site say that is discussing a topic and has adsense, and though this site is totally in English and geared to people in New York City, some of the adsense adverts are in Hebrew based upon the content of the page I am on. The algorithm finds key words (more on those later) and feeds out the adverts.",
            "So our first lesson on Search Engines and ranking and all that good stuff is about Content. Remember the rule.",

And of course since we are creating our own blogs, (remember blogs is short slang for Weblogs - which is what their \"formal and official\" name is), most of our information is going to be <B>\"unique\"</B> and <B>\"Original\"</B>. Yet every now and then, since we are only human, and since we simply cannot \"create\" more and more information, we will copy information from other web sites. That is cool. There is no problem with that, UNLESS, you decide that \"copying\" and/or \"linking\" is simply better and forego writing anything.",
            "Now let me make this clear. If you are offering a service to people, where your main business is to offer out links to other places where people can get information, in other words you are a repository where people come to get links, because you already did all the research - that is fine. Because what you will loose in content, you will make up in \"eyeballs\" and \"hits\". Remember the end result of good search engine listings is just that. <B>MORE HITS - MORE EYEBALLS - MORE PEOPLE VISITING.</B>  And content is not the only parameter an Search Engine looks at. Not by a long shot.",
            "This is a critical point to keep in mind. Everything we will talk about, every method, from content to email to lists to whatever, (hehe my most unfavorite word in the English language pops in - Whatever - see my post on that word in my blog), has but one goal in mind. <B>To consistently and constantly increase and build your website \"hits\". To make sure you have an ever-growing \"fan\" club \"motivated\" because of the service you are offering, to come back. So please differentiate between the end goal and the methods. Content (discussed in our first article) is a method towards the goal of getting listed in a good position on a search engine, and the goal is to have people use and come to your web site or blog, and create a \"buzz\" about it.</B> (We will talk about this much later in our series.)",
            "Let us go back to content for a moment. Here we are talking about something that all writers know about and are familiar with. Text, words, phrases. Original, unique text.",
            "So in order to continue on our own fairly logical path, we will now concentrate on the \"text\" and what has to be in it. Which brings us to the subject of \"keywords\". Before explaining just what these are and either their importance or total invalidity and worthlessness these days, (and this is up for debate) let us define keywords more carefully.",
            "If you have a website selling hair beauty aids, you will want to sell your material writing content around what you are selling. Obviously if you write something about the difference between different models of dishwashers, this is not going to relate to the \"subject matter\" and content of your site. So you will write articles around your hair supplies. You will write articles on good hair care, on how to dye your hair, how to get rid of split-ends, how often to shampoo etc. etc.",
            "Our magic hair website is called \"Hair Is Not Forever\", and it is at www.hairisnotforever.com (I have no clue if such a site exists so please don't hit that link!) But this is our site for now and we will keep it as we go along. hairisnotforever also has a blog. This blog we will call \"SilkyFairHair\" and we will put it, for the sake of our example in blogger.com under the name of the proprietor who is aptly named Mr. Nor Hair. So now we have as follows:",

            "These names <B>ARE</B> important and so are the URL's. (URL stands for Universal Resource Locater). So keep them in mind as we go along through these articles especially when I get to the article on the importance of finding the right name.",
            "So Mr. Nor Hair and his wife, Mrs. Purple Hair work together. They create the site, get all the necessary stuff to sell something on it, write a couple of articles about hair and sit back and wait for the people to come beating their \"virtual\" door down. Well as we say in Hebrew, \"Boker Tov\" (which literally means \"Good Morning\"), or as you say in English, \"Knock. Knock. Good Morning! Anyone Home?\"",
            "Okay the Hair couple know about keywords. So they create articles in which EVERY sentence has the word hair in it (or balding). But hair is the name of the game. They make sure their content is original, and once they have written two HTML pages of hair articles, strategically placed by their cousin the graphic artist (who is bald) around the advertisements for hair products and now they think they are done!",
            "Woah! Not by a LONG SHOT! And here is where it gets depressing for the uninitiated and non-dedicated people.",
            "Let us deal with the <I><B>\"keyword\"</B></I> issue.",
            "Keywords are like indices or if you wish, categories. A keyword is something that the search engine will look for and validate (in our day), to use as one of the parameters as to how to list your site.",
            "The keywords we refer to are in two distinct and totally different places. The first in the page header of the site.",
            "in what is known as the section for \"meta\" tags. We will deal with meta tags in a different article, however let us just say these are the keywords most search engine look for (with their \"bots\") when visiting your site.",
            "An example meta tag for keywords on our site may look like this:",
            "<BLOCKQUOTE><META NAME=\"keywords\" CONTENT=\"hair, hair products, hair grooming, baldness, going bald, shampoo, conditioner, hair color, dying hair, split-ends, split ends, hair life, beautiful hair, luxurious hair\"></BLOCKQUOTE>",
            "Again in our article(s) on meta tags we will discuss these keywords, and meta tags, but for now take it as a given these are some of the keywords that will be in the meta tag.",
            "When the Search Engine technology first became popular and meta tags were implemented, the keywords tag was critical. Search Engines looked at the keywords in the meta tag and assumed that was what the site was about and listed the site under those keywords. This was caught on to immediately, and humans being the crafty devils they are, began listing keywords that had nothing to do with their sites in order to drive traffic to the site. (<B>Remember - the end result is the oh-so-important one: Hits & Eyeballs</B>)",
            "So porn sites especially, adopting this as yet another \"fool the engine\" technique, would put keywords like \"hair\", \"technology\" etc. into their meta tags, and give the site an innocuous name and voila, more traffic.",
            "So in the never-ending battle Search Engines caught on, and did a few things. They deprecated the importance of the keywords in the meta tags according to their algorithms, <B>UNLESS</B> the content on the site actually did match the keywords. Of course, this was not enough as porn sites will put \"real\" content around their stuff. I will give you a REAL example which I find funny, but it is very serious.",
            "In one of my posts on my blog, you can see my bio which is picked up by search engines. The other day I received an email from an old flame of mine saying \"I freaked out. I googled you, under Ted Gross Writer, and you are connected with a site about tushy's!\" So I go and Google it, and sure enough in like the fifth position is this: \"Ted Gross's Unofficial Bio - The Real Version by Tushy\" and of course I click and get led to another site (no url here as I do not want to publicize that site for obvious reasons) and I come to a porn site which ripped off, out of all the content on the internet, <B>MY</B> profile to place around their porn adverts. UGH! But you see that is how crafty people are!",
            "(Here we are not going to talk about \"splogs\" - meaning \"spam blogs\" yet. But keep it in mind.)",
            "Okay now what happens - not in theory but in practice.",
            "Two scenarios:",
            "1. You have keywords in your meta tag (and you should have them!) The little Search Engine \"bot\" (that is a software program whose job it is to travel around the Internet, never sleeps and never eats and gets into all those porn sites too!, and picks up information on ALL sites so the information can be categorized), comes to our site of hairisnotforever and reads the keywords on the page. Then this little bot makes a snapshot of the web page. Then the algorithms take over and match the keywords in the meta tags to the text and stuff on your site. (Remember Search Engines don't \"see\", they are NOT visual (males are visually oriented not Search Engines!) so graphics are not taken into account unless you use the alt tag.) The algorithms get more and more sophisticated as time goes on and they look for content, keywords, phrases etc. (Remember original content!)",
            "2. You have no keywords in your meta tag so the engine just looks at your content.",
            "So our happy couple figures okay lets put the word hair say, in every sentence at least three times. NO! Don't do that. Overuse of a keyword is a red-flag to a Search Engine and you will be penalized for it! It should be used and used frequently, but NOT overused.",
            "Now when you Google for hair products using the word \"balding\", the Search Engine has the keyword, and based upon a million parameters decides what position for that specific keyword, hairisnotforever will have, and feeds it out.",
            "So our couple figures what the hell. We will also sell mascara, and they put in a picture advert and the word mascara in their keywords, without having any content for it. Well then www.hairisnotforever.com will probably be listed as the last of the last of the last for anyone looking for \"mascara\".",
            "So for this lesson the formula is:",
            "<I><B>\"Content+Keywords in the content+Keywords in Meta tag.\"</B></I>"

When you begin a blog, you will notice that they are all laid out basically the same way. Some experts will call their layout the last-in-first style. This is a very tricky name that simply notes that the last thing the person, or blogger, wrote will show up at the top of the blog. Most blogging software allows for this automatically. When you sign up at a blogging site and are given your own blog space, you will likely see that after you finish typing your post and submit it, the blogging software will automatically put your last entry at the top of your blog.

A blog is typically a lot like a diary. It may not be quite as personal, or it may be even more personal. It all depends on how much you are willing to share. You can choose to make your blog anonymous by not including your name or any contact information. This will probably make you even more comfortable posting.

There are currently nine million blogs out there with 40,000 new ones being added everyday. Some are informative and some are just downright a waste of your time. And while we hear a lot about blogging these days, what is blogging *really*? Blogging in its simplest term is like an online journal but much, much more powerful. Blogs (short for Web log) is a place where surfers can get up to the minute information on a topic or voyeur into someone's life. Some blogs are nothing more than a daily glimpse into someone's life, while others are so sophisticated, it's hard to tell them apart from an online news service.",

            "Google, the #1 search engine on the net, loves blogs. So much so that if you do it right Google will spider the heck out of your site. What does it mean to \"spider\"? Well spidering is when Google, or the like, searches your site\u2019s content to establish ranking, and the more content you have (i.e. fresh content) the more Google will do its magic and push your site up the search engine. Another reason blogs matter is that they are interactive and, if you blog on your book\u2019s topic, it will help to further your expert status on a particular issue. When we plan \"Virtual Tours\" for our authors, we include as many blogs as we can into a tour. Why? Because if you can get into a good blog that's seeing a lot of traffic, you can really start to gain some exposure for your book.",

An author I work with has a series of books starring one character - a private detective. I recommended that he \"blog\" this character, meaning that the character (not the author) would have the blog. It could be the character's diary or adventures and stories - a glimpse into the life of a private detective. This would give the reader (and fans of this character) a reason to return to the blog for an update on this ongoing adventure or story.",
            "In another instance, I work with an author who wrote a fiction book about right and wrong with a new age/spirituality spin. I advised him to blog on issues related to that - right and wrong in our society and his own personal \"spin\" on these issues. Some of his blogs might be controversial but that's okay, you want to create your own \"voice,\" your own take on a certain issue and if that opinion is controversial, all the better for exposure and for getting people to interact on your blog.

Some bloggers I know post daily, sometimes even multiple times a day while others post weekly. How much you post will probably depend on how much time you have to dedicate to this. The challenge will be that if you want to keep driving people to your blog, you'll want fresh content. This doesn't mean you have to create this all yourself, in fact you can invite people onto your blog and interview them, or you can just post a one paragraph \"thought\" on your topic. It doesn't have to be complicated or long, it just has to be fresh. Also be innovative, as we discussed earlier, be different with your blog, have fun with it. It might seem complicated at first but once you get the hang of it, you'll quickly become a blog expert!"

            "Do you know what search terms your visitors are using to find you? Most blogging sites give you the option of checking up to see just how people found you. If you don\u2019t have this feature available, hop over to http://www.statcounter.com/ and install their free service on your blog immediately.",

            "Submitting to Directories",
            "Your third step is to take these keyword optimized blog postings and post them to the article and blog directories.

            "With all blog postings, content is key. Without useful, interesting information that cannot be found elsewhere, your visitors won\u2019t come back for more. Incorporate these simple search engine optimization techniques into your blogging practice however, and you\u2019ll both keep the visitors you already have and dramatically increase your readership through high ranking search engine placement in no time."

            "I am presuming that you have optimised your site, added numerous pages of content and update or add to that content at least on a weekly basis. All of this I did with our own website but still the search engines only visited the site about every 4 \u2013 6 weeks. So although our content was being added to sometimes on a daily basis I couldn\u2019t induce the Google spider in particular to visit the site more often even though I was submitting sitemaps to Google.which informed it of these updates.",
            "I then started reading about the benefits to businesses of having a weblog attached to the site. SEO\u2019s were and still do wax lyrical about how search engines just love weblogs. On this basis I decided to give it a go and looked around at the various free blog sites and finally settled on http://www.blogger.com as this site allowed the blog to be integrated into the website and offered a multitude of templates to choose from. So I chose my template and went through the process of integration with the website which is a very simple and easy process to follow. The next step was to start writing the blog. Very quickly I discovered that it was the ideal vehicle for announcing new services, new products and new branch openings as well as informing the readers of our day to day activities and experiences. All of it is excellent content and the SEO\u2019s were quite correct in that the search engine spiders do love it. So much so that the googlebot spider visits everyday to update the web pages and the weblog. This now means that when my content changes or new pages are added they are immediately indexed by Google. This has done wonders for the search engine placement of the site.",
            "The second benefit that SEO\u2019s talked about was the increased number of links that having a blog would bring in. This part I didn\u2019t quite believe as I couldn\u2019t see how it would do this. I am still not certain of how and why it does attract links but the truth of the matter is that it does. The articles and the weblog seem to inhabit a world of their own and they certainly take on a life which you have no control over. However the combined effect is to boost your own content, attract search engines to visit your site frequently, increase the number of backlinks to your site and increase the number of visitors. All of which are of tremendous benefit to you as a business.",
            "The latest figures I saw published for the number of businesses with weblogs was only 2%. So all you small businesses out there with a website, get writing articles and add a weblog to your site. Keep that updated, preferably on a daily basis, and you will soon see dramatic effects both on your visitor numbers and your search engine placement."

            "1. Have a theme. This helps attract readers. It provides a framework around which to blog. I chose Time Leadership as my theme. I have had a long interest in the use of time and published an audio book on time management. I am constantly looking for new time reducing ideas to add to my present material.",
            "2. Blogging obligates you to do more blogging. It is just like writing a newspaper column. If you have a lot of people reading your blog, they expect to see new material. I blog about 5 or 6 days per week and occasionally skip a day, but not often. I now know the pressure writers on deadlines must feel.",
            "3. Blogging is a two-way street. You must respond to the comments you will get. The larger the blog following, the more comments you will get.",
            "4. Blogging takes time. One of my time rules is \u2013 if I add something to my schedule that takes time; I need to delete something that takes the same amount of time. For me, it takes about 15 to 20 minutes per day and I write quickly and keep it brief.",
            "5. Be legal. Of course this is obvious but I mean more than just being legal -- be careful of giving away information that could be considered to be business confidential. There have been cases where people have lost their job because the company does not like what has been said in the blog.",
            "6. Keep a file of blog ideas. I keep an electronic file and a paper one. This material gives me something to say when sometimes I am not as inspired to blog. It can also be something that prompts me on writing in my blog. I know I often find myself thinking in terms of what might make good blog material.",
            "7. Provide links from your blog. People who read blogs are used to being able to click on interesting topics and going right to the web page with the information. After all, this is the internet.",
            "8. Only start blogging if you like to write. Even though I like to write, I do often find it to be a bit of a challenge.",
            "9. Be authentic. I think the readers appreciate it. I think it would be hard to have a ghost writer do a blog. It would be difficult to appear real.",
            "10. Be patient. Don\u2019t expect 10,000 readers in the first month. Readership grows over time. I follow my stats, and I notice my weekend readership is about half my readership during the week.",
            "And now that I have written this article \u2013 am I less mysterious?"

That too is a wonderful idea. The thing to remember is, before you can ask for help, you\u2019d still need to know where to start.",

How about if we talk about the cake, invitations or the reception? Yes, these topics are all covered.",

You may find that being ala Britney Spears in Vegas isn\u2019t what you want to do at all. There are so many options such as Italy or the Caribbean or even just a small resort just near your home that will do just as well to give you a nice simple wedding, relaxed and stress free, without breaking your bank.",

            "Writing often is advice that most bloggers come across on other sites. The reason why it is popular advice is due to the fact that it is based on the assumption that posting often demonstrates that you are committed to what you do. This results in visitors and readers coming back to your blog to see and read about what you\u2019re up to. Posting too often may sometimes have the opposite effect. Visiting a blog for the second time, readers might be looking for the same post to re-read or something similar. Forcing your readers to go through a bunch of new posts, 1, 2 sometimes 3 a day might be a deterring factor. In these cases I will just use a search engine to find what I am looking for. Furthermore, the 2nd and 3rd posts of the day are usually of lesser quality due to writers fatigue and therefore less interesting. Instead of posting several times a day just post once a day or just whenever you think you have something interesting or useful to write about. Put some though in your posts, give your readers a reason to come back and always avoid bombarding them with clutter. Focus your effort on a few good topics.",
            "Optimize your Blog for Search Engines",
            "Most bloggers out there start blogging the wrong way. After they start blogging they do so by relying primarily on social networks for traffic.  Social network traffic is great but it rarely converts into money. The best traffic to make money is search engine traffic. A blogging tip everyone should get a chance to read and re-read is that search engine traffic will be the most profitable kind. Although Social networking is an easy way to generate traffic you should always spend some time to make sure your blog and posts are properly optimized to rank well in search engine result pages. Take a few hours a week and perform a few scheduled and simple search engine optimization tasks.",

            "Make sure your titles are relevant to your topic, make sure you refer to your topic keywords throughout your posts, and make sure you tag your posts properly. Also make sure to interlink your posts with older relevant posts.  Always use keywords you are interested in ranking high for and keep these keywords concentrated around a specific topic.",
            "From other sites",
            "Get as many one way inbound links with anchor text as you can; by many I mean thousands. Think of your site or your blog as a property you acquired in the country side. After you start building you will need to make a road, get it hooked up with power and so one. Backlinks are the essentials your blog or site will need to prosper. Don\u2019t only rely on other bloggers to link to you. Create backlinks to your blog by submitting articles in databases. Write a few 500 word articles on similar topics you write about in your blog, add back links with ancor text and start submitting. Ideally you should submit a few articles to thousands of directories for every post you write. There is software available to help you do this. Do the same thing for every post. You can easily create thousands of one way links your blog and particular posts in less than a few hours.",

Go back to them and optimize them. Add more keywords, make the title catchier, tag them better or even elaborate on certain things you wrote and think will help them rank better in searches."

I would be careful with this one because you don\u2019t want to lose your blogging voice or make your pages read awkwardly by jamming in as many keywords as you can. Do check for the most popular keywords in your universe, though, using a tool like WordTracker. As a poster on SitePoint said, using the competition values in WordTracker allows you to pick keywords that haven\u2019t soaked the web yet.",
            "2. Use a service like PinGoat to ping blogger indexing sites every time you change your site. Pinging is basically extending an invitation to indexing services like Technorati, IceRocket and Feedster to come to your site and index it. The more indexing you get, the more exposure you get. PinGoat is a terrific service that pings them all at the same time.",
            "3. Update your Google Sitemap every few posts and resubmit it. A Google Sitemap is an interesting and amazing phenomenon. Here is how Google explains it:",
            "The Google Sitemaps program is two-way communication between webmasters and Google. You can give us information about your site so we can index it more effectively, and we can show you how we see your site and tell you about any trouble we\u2019ve had crawling it.",
            "Basically you create a special xml file and tell Google to go look at it. It uses the file to better index the site. And it definitely works. There\u2019s even a Plugin for WordPress that will build the perfect sitemap for Google. You can read more about sitemaps by visiting the Google Sitemapspage.",
            "4. Post relevant comments on blogs related to your content area. Look around, find people blogging about the same stuff as you. Monitor their blog sites and participate in the discussion. Be sure to include a link to your site in all of your comments. It\u2019s a great way to correspond with like-minded people and get your name and site name out there.",
            "5. Search for link partners and link exchanges at least once a week. If you find a site you like, include it on your link page and drop the site owner an email. He or she will most likely list your site as well. Join a couple of free or cheap link exchange sites and stick to your subject area when exchanging links. Always visit the prospective link exchange site and ask yourself if you would be doing your readers a service by sending them to that site. If not, don\u2019t link to the site.",
            "6. Write great content, and don\u2019t plug stuff unless you are familiar with it and approve of it. If you write interesting content about subjects that interest people they will always find you. Don\u2019t hustle your readers \u2014 if you are going to plug something for money, make sure the product or service is something you would use and recommend. If people sense a hustle they will not convert and they will not come back.",
            "7. Watch your keywords and make sure they are performing. DigitalPoint has a terrific tool that will help you track your keyword placement over time so you can see how your efforts are doing.",
            "8. Perform some basic Search Engine Optimization. Learn how to not only optimize your posts, but optimize your entire site. You can get some great tips and tools at SeoChat.com",
            "9. Shake loose a couple of bucks and buy some ad space. Once you\u2019re certain your blog looks and operates perfectly, spend $100 on Adsense ads and see how that helps.",
            "10. Be patient. It isn\u2019t going to happen overnight. It will take weeks or months to get things rolling."

It may be more difficult to enter a more competitive marketplace, but the potential rewards are far greater, too.  The key to this element of topic selection, however, is not just writing a blog on a hot topic.  It is finding a field from which a healthy number of visitors can be culled.",
            "Third, one will want to find a market that is underserved.  Basically, you are looking for a strong disparity in the number of interested parties and the amount of readily available information.  If you can find a topic in which many people are interested but that is not well-covered online, you will be sitting upon a potential blogging gold mine.  It is perfectly acceptable to build a wonderful blog and to expend the effort to compete in a more crowded area, but this does require much more work.  Finding an underserved niche and filling a hole in the marketplace is a much easier way to produce blogging revenue.",
            "Choosing a topic for your moneymaking blog can be a challenging process.  This first step, however, is probably one of the most important.  The choice of a topic not only establishes the nature of the blog, it also (in large measure) determines its potential for success."

            "I have two Dads. That sounds strange doesn\u2019t it? One is my genetic father, and the other is my geneticist father. The genetic Dad I\u2019ve only ever lived with for one year when I was an infant, while the geneticist Dad is what you would call a step-father, but I\u2019ve lived in close proximity with him for more than 20 years. I feel close to them both. I connect differently with each of them but on a pretty much equal level.  The reason I\u2019m sharing my personal information with you is because I\u2019ve just had a realisation about my fathers in relation to the area that I work in: computers and the Internet. It\u2019s really quite interesting.",

My other father has an old piece-of-crap box that looks something like a computer, with a tediously slow dial-up connection to the World Wide Web. Compared to the wireless, broadband Mac personal computer and mobile-connected Mac laptop of the enthusiast, they couldn\u2019t be from further parts of the galaxy.",
            "Then there\u2019s me. I could be construed as being a walking paradox, an enigma, or just plainly twisted when it comes to my relationship with the computer and Internet sphere of life. Nature/nurture, genetic/environmental\u2026For whatever strange reason, I have turned out to be a combination of the two papas. I work as a creative writer for an Internet web-hosting company. I love the ideas and valuable functions and tools that the Internet has brought to humanity (or was it humanity that brought it to the Internet?). However, I have issues and challenges when it comes to using these awe-inspiring machines.",
            "Currently I am away from home in a different city visiting my girlfriend. At home (I am currently living with my parents-Mother and geneticist, as I\u2019m going to live overseas soon) all I have to do to get on the Internet is open up my laptop and I\u2019m on-line. If I\u2019m at work, I go to my PC and all of my settings are stored and ready for me to use. While in a new place, things haven\u2019t been running as smoothly as I would\u2019ve liked. The answers are probably simple and easy to do, but this is one of the kinds of challenges that cause me to stumble. Although I am deeply interested and have a true faith in this new technology, I am a real novice when it comes to getting things done on someone else\u2019s computer.",
            "I brought my laptop with me. My girlfriend only has a dial-up connection which she uses with her laptop. I could use hers\u2019 but she\u2019s Chinese so a lot of what comes up on the screen is illegible to me. I don\u2019t know how to change her language configuration. I\u2019m used to doing it quite easily on my Mac, but her computer is a PC and I\u2019m not as practiced in this other format. That\u2019s one of my problems. I only have so much patience when it comes to working these technological issues out; it could be a trait passed on by my ice-age father (No judgement is being laid here. He just doesn\u2019t feel that he can work new technologies out. He\u2019s had a digital telephone answering machine for two years which he still hasn\u2019t set up. He feels bad about it but his manual one does the job, so he sticks with it.). I\u2019m also a little afraid to hook my laptop up to her dial-up line as I know from experience that I\u2019ll have to change some settings of which I am not confident about doing.",
            "So the next answer was to go to her university where she said people use their laptops wirelessly in the library. That sounded cool so I went in and tried it out. I even tried changing the settings to get it to work (It took courage.) but I couldn\u2019t get it to work. I was weary about asking for help because I wasn\u2019t really a student at that particular learning establishment. Instead, I\u2019ve been using the library\u2019s computers. This is OK, but since I can\u2019t walk away with the files I create (I borrowed my girlfriend\u2019s thumb-drive but an experience from the past of not being able to transfer information from PC to Mac deters me from using it-again, an irrational fear. I know it, and I will give it a try this week. I\u2019ve resorted to saving my files in my email account as attachments. It\u2019s not conventional, but it works.",
            "Another issue I\u2019ve had is getting onto my messenger service. The university computers don\u2019t have it on their desktop, and when I tried to download an on-line version I was told that I didn\u2019t have the authority to do so. I went to an Internet caf\u00e9, and I could do work there (I\u2019m working on the road) but I feel kind of silly paying to get paid. It was cool there though as they had messenger with voice and video and I was able to have a conversation with my brother who is travelling around India. He could see my sister and me, but we couldn\u2019t see him as he said the Indian computer devices (webcams, headsets) in that town were looking a little bit crappy in design and also looked worse for wear. It was heaps of fun making funny faces knowing that he would be seeing us. I think he\u2019s getting lonely as he\u2019s only 19 years old and has been away from home for over 7 months.",
            "As you can see I\u2019ve inherited beliefs about computer from both of my Dads. I find things more difficult than most, I believe, but I\u2019m not going to give up doing my best to get the things done that I feel are necessary. Over time I hope to get over these little obstacles and hurdles and become proficient in all of the cool aspects of this new realm of human endeavour. I also have faith that the technicians and engineers are probably working hard to make things simple for the rest of us.",
            "Whatever happens, I\u2019m going to stick with it, and when I go to see my genetic father next I\u2019m going to do my best to inspire him to buy a new computer with a Broadband connection. Then all I have to do is show him a few of the amazing things that this human created Internet tool can do. One of the aspects of the Web that affects me most profoundly is the simple fact that if you think of anything at all in the known Universe, you can then look it up on your search engine like Google and in the time it takes to blink your eye, immediately start to learn. It sure beats catching the train to the library, looking up a book in the card catalogue, searching for it, then finding out that someone else has borrowed it and is late bringing it back."

            "So you have become a blogger. You have joined the legions of those keeping web logs and journals online. How do you make it fresh, though? How do you stand out and show the world that your blog is worth a read? Well there are a number of things you can do from optimizing your content to making sure you are consistent in your updates. However, consider the idea of adding pictures to your blog. A great deal of blog success can be had by making pictures a big part of what you are doing on your journal. Post them, link to them, or do whatever you have to, but pictures can be the difference in your blog being simply a fun hobby or being a big success.",
            "In order to understand why pictures are a part of blogging success, you should make sure that you understand what the world of blogging is all about. For the most part, blogs are often used to sell something. It can be a product or it can simply be your own ideas and readership. Either way, you want your blog to be read. So everything you do with your blog will likely be done as part of making it interesting to your designated audience, right? Keep that in mind as you put everything together.",
            "Most any good blog is going to have a theme. Before you begin your blog you need to figure out what your theme is. Is it your life? Is it your philosophies? No matter what, there is no better way to make a point about your theme than with photos or pictures. Most any blog site has the tools for uploading pictures, so make sure you are using them. Potential readers will be able to see just what you are all about as soon as they see your blog page without having to read a lot to see whether or not they want to continue reading your page. When you have an instant impact with pictures it will be much easier for you to end up with a successful blog.",
            "For many people, the blog is a tool they use to market a product and drive up sales or services they offer that go hand in hand with their blog. With good pictures and photos you can keep your products in front of your readers at all times. You can put images of the products along the side of your page or you can place them strategically through the blog site. In addition, you can then advertise without bombing your readers with your propaganda in the text. Nobody wants to read a bunch of ads, but if you post pictures, you can advertise without advertising all over your actual blog content. Either way, the photos and images will be added way of making your blog a success for you.",
            "Another reason that pictures can be a big key to blog success is simply a matter of aesthetics. Images will make your blog look nicer and if it looks nicer it will then attract more readers. It all makes sense. I mean, would you want to publish a book with a boring blank cover? Of course you wouldn\u2019t. The same goes for your blog. In essence, a well kept blog is like your online book and with good images you are making for a nice cover. They may say not to judge a book by its cover, but many do anyway so you might as well have a nice looking one just to be safe.",
            "The truth is that whether you are talking about blogs, magazines, or television, we live in a society that is very visual. So when it comes to a good blog, readers expect to see pictures and images that will titillate them and keep them engaged in the information. So, the key is to keep your images fresh and consistent so that they help accentuate your points and support your themes and ideas. You can get your pictures and images from your own library of images and pictures you have taken on vacations, around your home, or even just in your town. You can also download free images that are available online, link to other blogs or even use other images if you are willing to pay the royalties. No matter what, though, the key to blogging success is very closely tied to the images and visual quality of your blog. Newspapers and magazines would not sell as well if they lacked images, and your blog will operate just the same way."

Many people that have never had any other kind of web presence before find themselves drawn to blogging, partly because it is so easy to find a way to blog for free.",
            "Compared to starting your own blog from scratch, signing up with a free blogging web site will get you listed in search engines much easier. For example, Google, that runs the free blog hosting site Blogspot, crawls its pages very often to look for updates.  As a result, if you have a Blogspot blog, you are almost guaranteed to be listed on Google's blog search engine. This way you can spend less time on promoting your blog, and you can gain a following with a minimum of marketing effort.",
            "If your blog attracts many readers, you may want to think about moving your site. Many people think that a blog that is hosted by a free blogging web site has a kind of amateur flavor, not appropriate for a high-profile blog. Your own domain name can help you make your  blog feel professional, and finding a webhost is not difficult or expensive. Once your blog starts to attract a large readership, you will probably be able to sell enough advertising space to be able to afford to buy your own domain and pay for a hosting package, and still have money left over. However, until you have a sizeable readership, there\u2019s really no need to invest in these luxuries.",
            "When you want to build a following before you spend any money on your blog, using a free blogging website is a good idea. Later, when you feel ready to take the next step and pay for your own domain, your readers will follow you to your new home."

And, like thousands of other innovative inventors with a new product concept, bringing that idea into a marketplace dominated by long established brands with deep links and dominance in the retail outlets is challenging.

            "Austin entrepreneur, Richard Trocino had a great product idea. And, like thousands of other innovative inventors with a new product concept, bringing that idea into a marketplace dominated by long established brands with deep links and dominance in the retail outlets is challenging. In these days of mega corporations and Walmarts, VCs and small business defined by the government in the land of opportunity, one entrepreneur with a grand idea or product may be considered by any of those groups as irrelevant and insignificant. Another challenge faced by small businesses in today\u2019s marketplace, like in Trocino\u2019s case, is getting an idea produced and generating sales.",
            "In spite of impossible odds, Trocino\u2019s invention sells almost faster today than his factories can produce and distribute all over the world. The established companies that were given the opportunity to brand and produce it, now may be wishing they had not dismissed the popular product so readily. Not when the blogosphere is broadcasting around the globe faster and with more range than a speeding bullet; comments appearing include; \u201cOHSO gets my nod for the most stylish and futuristic toothbrush/toothpaste contraption on the market today\u201d, \u201cThe Coolest Toothbrush Ever\u201d, and \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Elegant Travel Toothbrush\u201d.",
            "Trocino received micro level funding to get the prototypes built and into limited manufacturing through friends and family after attempts to license the product to both toothpaste and toothbrush companies fell on deaf ears. Similarly, Trocino found his innovation locked out of normal channels of retailing without the benefits of an established proven brand in the marketplace.",
            "Discouraged, but undaunted Trocino abandoned efforts to take the product to market using traditional marketing methods. Instead, like entrepreneurs who have met with unexpected success throughout business history he proceeded by seat of the pants and gut instinct. Acting on a hunch, he put it out there exclusively in the world of the internet and ignored the traditional \u201cwisdom\u201d of standard marketing techniques\u2014no phones, faxes, or printed paper junk mail\u2014nothing but net. A guerrilla marketer does not have the luxury of the corporate behemoths who can afford (since it\u2019s investor\u2019s and stockholders money not their own) to throw 98% of their marketing dollars away on a numbers game in a business model that justifies and covers its inherent wastefulness by overcharging those sold customers the expenses of marketing to everyone else.",
            "Trocino decided to be a \u201cSwamp Fox\u201d marketer, like General Francis Marion who befuddled the British in South Carolina during the Revolutionary war, and break all the rules of modern marketing warfare. Marketing is a form of warfare and many entrepreneurs have discovered the reality of today\u2019s business battlefields. The corporations and financiers have in today\u2019s market reality stacked the deck against upstart competition by raising the ante into the game of commerce. One unnamed entrepreneurial internet advice columnist estimates the cost of entry to even be considered for funding by an angel or VC group at between $25,000 and $250,000. That is merely for the development of the business plan, and pre-start up consulting, general expenses and to purchase access to their secretive inner circle. Trocino decided to wander into the unknown swamp of the internet and blogsphere and see what people would do when offered his innovation directly.",
            "Trocino, like most entrepreneurs, is a risk taker, but like most smart business persons likes to reduce risk wherever possible. He knew a good concept poorly executed had little chance of success in the market, so he took his idea to a locally based but internationally known design firm called \u201cDesign Edge\u201d and negotiated a co-marketing partnership for assistance in \u2018packaging\u2019 his innovation. Trocino knew that people who travel a lot would naturally respond favorably to the concept of an integrated toothpaste dispensing toothbrush in a self contained case that protects clothing in suitcases as well as keeps things neat and sanitary. With the co-marketing partnership with \u2018Design Edge\u2019 the product took on a new personality within a sexy futuristic design that takes the basic utilitarian idea and wraps it in fashionability and elegance.",
            "Then with a few well chosen words, a friend with a good photographic eye and a smattering of html code, Trocino put up a website at http://www.goOHSO.com, and invited a few friends through http://MySpace.com to look at his new line of toothbrushes. MySpace would become the testing ground and ultimate launch pad for the rollout of his product.",
            "With its stylish modern design and elegant photography, the buzz it generated in cyberspace was somewhat unexpected. In fact, it was explosive!",
            "Driven by the dynamics of blogosphere where coolness and fashionability become badges of personal taste and sophistication, the OHSO toothbrush rapidly found its way onto the personal blogs of graphic designers, and jet setters as the coolest thing since crystal ice. When Josh Spears, the blogger\u2019s blogger posted his rave of the sleek product, sales and global visibility exploded. Even the legendary Steven Wozniak, the cofounder of another innovative product, Apple computer, is counted among the OHSO toothbrush users and fans.",
            "Today the product is available in high fashion boutiques in the swanky Beverly Hills bastions of elegance and among the cappuccino makers and executive toys on the shelves of Brookstone stores around the country. Blogs have elevated the sensible, functional, practical toothbrush for harried travelers into fashion statements that provide high status and cool despite it\u2019s less than $20 price tag.",
            "Not a bad state of affairs for the beaming Trocino who is today expanding the line with even more designs to satisfy the market demands. OHSO is a product that owes its success to a seat of the pants approach to beat the corporate gorillas with a bit of his own guerilla marketing. He simply put it out there in the vast uncharted cyber world where the old MBA strategies have no more influence on the hip youth market than the full color fall outs in the increasing unread Sunday paper.",
            "Today freedom of the personal press in the global Blogsville rules a small voice with a message, or product like the OHSO toothbrush, can be magnified into a global phenomena. When people like what they see, they tell their friends, who today are everywhere. Just like Richard Trocino\u2019s classy and well designed toothbrush."

            "When you use a web log as the platform for your newsletter or ezine, you can post each of your promotions to the web, and then invite your subscribers to your blog to view your most recent update. When readers follow the link from your email to your latest blog post, they will not only have the opportunity to respond to the current promotion, they will be able to browse your blog and take action on offers you made last week, last month, even last year.",
            "Quite often when I mail my list about my latest blog post, I end up making new sales on a promotion I did some time ago. And since my blog is linked to all of my other web sites, it\u2019s easy for me to generate traffic for multiple products and services with just one mailing.",
            "And blogging is a great way to generate new web traffic for your domain. By setting your blog software to \u2018ping\u2019 search and directory portals each time you make a post, you can alert a large number of people about your new content with the single click of a button.",
            "Also, search engines are more likely to spider your site on a regular basis if you update your content frequently. With blog software, making changes to the text on your web pages is as simple as sending an email; you just fill in a subject line and post body, and then click \u2018submit\u2019.",
            "You can even configure your blog so readers are able to leave comments and questions about your articles. They don\u2019t have to take the time to send you an email, they can just click on the comments link and post their feedback right there on the spot. This is one of the easiest ways possible to encourage productive interaction among your prospects and customers.",
            "Blogging requires no special technical knowledge. Sure there is an advanced side to this marketing strategy, but just adding a web log to your domain and making posts on a regular basis can improve your traffic flow and customer response tremendously."

I\u2019m not claiming to be the blogging guru of all time or anything of the sort. So before you \u201cblogging consultants\u201d out there start getting defensive about this, think before you write. If you get too nasty about the post I may ask you to define \u201cblogging consultant\u201d and without google many of you couldn\u2019t do it.",
            "Now that is out of the way, lets talk business. Every business should have a blog. There are so many reasons for your business to have a blog it would be hard to write them all in one blog post, so lets assume you know your company needs a blog.",
            "So do you hire a blogging consultant? What qualifications do you look for in a blogging consultant? What does a blogging consultant look like? How much should I pay a blogging consultant?",
            "Lets start with \u201cShould you hire a blogging consultant?\u201d",
            "The quick answer is yes, but lets go into why first. There are a lot of things that go into making a blog popular. Technorati tags, submissions and pings to bloglists and blogsearch websites, learning how to get on the right blogrolls, etc.",
            "If you are new to blogging it takes awhile to catch on to most of these things and most blogging consultants say that all of the above is necessary if you are going to have a successful blog.",
            "There are more things to add to the list but this article isn\u2019t about how to run a successful blog, it\u2019s about blogging consultants. Hiring a blogging consultant can save you from making a lot of early mistakes and get your blog found a lot quicker than trying to do it on your own.",
            "Now all the blogging consultants are liking me again. I can tell. But will it last?",
            "What qualifications do you look for in a blogging consultant?",
            "Here is where things get ugly between me and the blogging consultants. Most blogging consultants are . . . well . . . bloggers. Many of them have what they think is a successful blog although many bloggers have different ideas for what success is.",
            "Some think it\u2019s defined as how much they made on google adnonsense last month. Others count success by number of visitors to their website or the number of comments that appear on their blog. Still others measure their success by what the other bloggers think about them.",
            "What do all of those bloggers who are blogging consultants have in common? They all think that having a successful blog automatically makes you a qualified blogging consultant. I told you it was going to get nasty. After this article if I measured my success by what the other bloggers think of me then I\u2019m doomed!",
            "Fortunately I don\u2019t measure my success in terms of what the other bloggers and blogging consultants think. Lets get back to those qualifications for a blogging consultant.",
            "First of all a blog is a website. It is a website that is updated often in most cases, but it is still a website. Each blogpost becomes a page of that website. So with a blog you are creating more webpages to your website as often as you post to your blog.",
            "Now I have a question for you. Would you first look to hire a blogger to do search engine optimization for your website? Would you first look to hire a blogger to handle your AdWords campaign? Would you first look for a blogger to build your website for you?",
            "The answer to all of the above is probably no, unless the blogger also has experience in those fields and not just for their blog. Actual websites they have built, optimized, and marketed for themselves and for clients.",
            "A blogging consultant should not just be a blogger. They should also have all of the skills necessary to run a website. Now the blogging consultants are all mad at me again. But think about it. Many bloggers know how to write. They know how to get into the right circle of blogger friends who will link to them. They know about blogging.",
            "So if all you need to know is how to write a blog, then hiring a blogger who knows how to write is the answer, but if you need someone who is going to manage your blog for you including posting to the blog, search engine optimization, link popularity, (and not just from blogrolls), and marketing, then you need to hire a webmaster who also blogs.",
            "Okay, How much should I pay a blogging consultant?",
            "How much do you have? Just kidding. A lot depends on the type of blog you want or have. A corporation blog has to pay more, not because they have more, but because there are all kinds of legal and policy matters that have to be considered with every single blog post and every single link to or from another blog or website. A small business blog doesn\u2019t have many of the same issues as the corporate blog, but still has certain standards that need to be met.",
            "If you have ever hired a webmaster, not a web designer, a webmaster, (Thats another article), or a Search Engine Optimization Company, or a Search Engine Marketer, or even just a Marketing Consultant, (The just was in there just so I could make consultants mad again.), then you have an idea of what a blogging consultant should cost.",
            "Now keep in mind, if you are hiring a blogging consultant to strictly teach you how to blog, then it\u2019s not worth as much money as when you hire a blogging consultant who is also going to perform all of the services a Webmaster and Internet Marketer would provide plus search engine optimization.",
            "Ha ha! I still didn\u2019t say how much it costs. It\u2019s coming. Read on.",
            "What does a Blogging Consultant look like?",
            "He or she looks like someone who has more than just a blog or blogs. Someone who also owns and manages several websites for themselves and for clients. As I said before a blog is still a website."

They also change to reflect what's going on in the world and with your target market.",
            "Keeping up with the news is also a good idea...you can find news feeds to add to your RSS reader too. When something is happening in the world that impacts your target market, blog it.",
            "3) Keep a notebook (or file on your desktop) of blog fodder",
            "When a thought or sentence hits you, write it down immediately. These sentences can be lengthened into blog posts (and later lengthened into articles...that's another ecourse!). The more you do this, the more aware you will become of the unlimited topics you can blog about, even in your niche.",
            "4) Milk Your Content",
            "If you're publishing a newsletter and write articles, then blog a short intro paragraph along with a link to the rest of the content on your website.",
            "5) Product Reviews",
            "Review products that you've tried and books you've read that relate to your niche. Anything that would help your blog readers make a decision (and we all need that help in a world with too many choices!) is a good thing.",
            "6) Involve Your Visitors",
            "Your newsletter subscribers and blog readers can be marketing partners and content generators for you! How? When they email you with a question, ask their permission to post it (along with the answer) on your blog.",

Hence, it is very important to come with a write up that everybody can understand, not necessarily that these people can relate to it but they can understand it.",

            "To make your blogging worth the browsing effort of your readers, it would be extremely nice if you will put some pictures in it. It does not necessarily mean you have to place a picture of yourself. Any photographs will do as long as it does not pose danger or insult to anyone who will be reading your blog.",

            "Technical specialties and skills, not necessary. Publishing freedom, an advantage. All that is needed is for you to have a witty mind, a desire to share ideas and part of your story, and a bit of knowledge to toggle into the internet. Grammatical errors are welcome. No editors and publishing companies to please. Journalism without rules or guidelines to follow and what\u2019s best is that readers could post a comment or be inspired to write one too.",
            "Blogging wouldn\u2019t be difficult if you have the right recipes. Not just a simple-text article, a blog may be enhanced or converted into other types like an audio blog or a video blog. Nowadays, blogs are more sophisticated and advanced. Element of a blog starts from a good and captivating headline down to the author\u2019s personal profile. Included herewith are the blog post, permalink (combined term for \u201cpermanent link\u201d), and the reader\u2019s comments.",
            "A friend of mine is a blogger. She would entertain herself by posting blogs on her web page. She told me that blogging is an advantage for her to speak up to the world of the things that\u2019s keeping her shut. And I quote, \u201cI am an internet junkie. I am not a big fan of journalism or any kind of writing.",
            "But it all changed when the blogging fever entered internet society. I appreciated it more when I felt everything that\u2019s written are real and not just a compulsory decoy to deliver information. Right then, I became a part of a bigger picture.\u201d",
            "Trapped in a world of unwanted opinions, blogging is a benefit. But everything has its own consequences. Blogs are much harder to manage than that of the broadcast media. In politically sensitive issues, blogs can be considered as a political misfit. Results are triggered through suppression of bloggers and punishments were made. Another grave case is the issue of defamation and liability.",
            "Nevertheless, blogging is still out there. So if you\u2019re the type who has the snap for writing, give blogging a shot. You never know how much it would contribute to the society and to your pockets."

            "2. By sharing your valuable knowledge, you\u2019re giving your customers a reason both to stay and to return. It\u2019s a proven fact that the more time a user spends on a site, the more likely they are to purchase something. The more your readers return for your expertise, the more you increase your sales.",

Let your users leave comments, and find out what changes they\u2019d like to see or what products they\u2019d like you to carry. Says Perry, \u201cBlogging\u2019s a tool that lets you communicate with your customer base in a way that\u2019s far more intimate than a monthly e-newsletter.\u201d"

You may just want a way to polish your writing skills, or perhaps you even have thoughts of some day putting a little extra walking around money in your pocket. No matter what your reason, you likely want to know where it is you should start in your blogging. Well, first of all you are going to need some sort of blogging platform or software to create your blog in the first place. There are hundreds of options out there, so what you need to do is choose the blogging software that is best for you. Here are some tips on what to look for to get the best blogging software for you.",
            "First of all you have to make a decision on what the reason for your blogging is. Are you doing it to try and earn some extra money, to record your own daily reflections, to polish your writing style, or for some other reason? The reason you are doing it will have a lot to do with what you want to accomplish with the site. For instance, if you are doing it only for personal reasons, then you may just want to seek out the first free blog hosting website you can find that you like. On the other hand, if you are doing it to earn money you may be much pickier about what you want in terms of blogging software. You might want the blog on your own site, or on a site where they help you promote it. No matter what the reason ends up being, it is that which will most affect your choice of blogging software and which one is best for you.",
            "Secondly, once you know why you are blogging, you need to figure out exactly which features are going to be most important to you on your blog. Are you going to want to be able to post pictures? Or are you just going to be typing text as your content? You may also want to look at what tools are available like the ability to link, or to archive your posts. Once you know why you are blogging and what type of blogging you want to do you are that much closer to knowing what you need in blogging software. Keep in mind, though, that the more features that you are getting with your blogging software the more you will likely pay for that software. So, you must decide early on what you need and don\u2019t need.",
            "Third, once you know why you want to blog and with what features you want to blog, it is time to start seeking out software. It is available all over the internet and even in computer stores now. You may first want to do a search because often times you can find web hosting and domain name registration software that will include blogging software applications with it. If you want to blog just to blog, then you may want to look at some of the free applications that allow you to just create a free account and then immediately begin blogging. On the other hand, if you want something on a website you have already established, and then look at software that may exist directly on your computer or through your hosting company. Much of it goes back to the first tip: know why you want to blog.",
            "Blogging is so popular now that many people feel like they are on the outside looking in if they don\u2019t have their own blog. The problem is that you may not know how to get started in the world of blogging. Obviously you cannot have a good blog until you have figured out the blogging software you want to use. There are a few types out there including blogging platforms at websites, purchased packages, and some that even come with website hosting and allow you to include a blog on your website. No matter what type you use, you need to make some decisions to help you figure out which blogging software is for you. If you decide why you want to blog, what blogging features you want, and how much you want to spend on it, this will help in the decision making. Once you have done all of that it is just a matter of sifting through the various blogging software packages out there and deciding which fits your needs the most. The search for blogging software that is best for you will become obvious."

So what is better?",
            "To answer this question, let\u2019s first look at how a blog is created. Just like creating web pages, first, you need a software or script that will take your entries, format it and publish it to the web. The second component of a blog, is the web space, where the software should publish to, a home for the blog pages.",
            "Knowing this information, let\u2019s review the different ways to host a blog:",
            "Full blog host.",
            "This is where the blogging system or software is provided for you and your blog is also published to a web space provided by the host. Blogger, SquareSpace and Typepad fall into this category. It\u2019s very much like creating a website with a site builder.",
            "Hosted blog software but published elsewhere",
            "This is where the blog software is provided for you but the blog pages are published to another website or web host altogether. By doing this, the software acts as a publishing system like FrontPage except it creates nicely formatted blogs. Blogger is probably the most well known for this. Yes Blogger can do both. Publish to their host or to yours. As a comparison, this is like using FrontPage to publish your website.",
            "Blog software and blog are hosted on your web server",
            "This is where you would install the blog script (software) on your web server \u2013 it can be any web hosting account. And when you publish, the blog itself resides on your web server also. To draw a parallel, this technique is like buying web hosting and then installing a content management system on it to help you build web pages.",
            "If you\u2019re new to building web pages or have built sites using site builders then you might want to go with a fully hosted blog. These hosts do all the nitty gritty for you and there\u2019s very little technical stuff you need to know. If you can point and click, you can build a blog with a full blog host.",
            "Having said that, just because you\u2019re seasoned at building web pages doesn\u2019t mean full blog hosts won\u2019t work for you. In fact, if you have many blogs this becomes very appealing since you won\u2019t have to worry about upgrading the blog script, people exploiting the script, making plug-ins work or what happens when your web host decides to disable part of your blog functions because there is a security hole. All you do is concentrate on blogging. After a while, blogging becomes more important than maintaining your blog and that\u2019s the way it should be.",
            "Next up, hosted software but blog is published to your website. This seems to be the best of both worlds. At time of writing, Blogger is one of the best ways to do this but because of its popularity often, you find the system too slow to publish or completely down just when you have a hot idea to share. The idea is good but you\u2019ll also be depending on someone else\u2019s availability to publish your blog. It\u2019s much like using a friend\u2019s computer to build your web pages and you know how that can go.",
            "Finally, you have the option to use scripts. This is also a very popular method. The flexibility it allows is very liberating because you can mould the blog anyway you want. You can even get a programmer to create custom plug-ins or customize the whole blogging system the way you want it. In short, you can do pretty much anything you want.",
            "The down side, you need at the very basic, some knowledge of HTML or publishing web pages. Also the burden of upgrading, troubleshooting and maintaining the script is on you. If you have one or two blogs it\u2019s not so bad but once you start having more, it can be quite tedious. You also have to consider all the other responsibilities of maintaining the script as mentioned earlier.",
            "Armed with this information, you should be able to figure out which one is for you. If you\u2019re still undecided, think of how you would do it if you\u2019re creating a regular website. Chances are your choice method for publishing a website is also the best method for you to create a blog."

The disadvantage is that it is not unique content and that anybody interested in the feed will likely click out on a story that appeals to them.",

It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, but you and your readers will find it the most rewarding way. If you feel that you just don\u2019t cut it as a writer or you genuinely don\u2019t have the time, then hire someone else to do it for you. There are many services out there who provide a \u201cblog service\u201d which includes daily posts of unique, engaging content and you can instruct these content writers as to where you want the links in your blog pointing to- so that any burden of cost in terms of hiring them should be offset by the gains in your increased visitor base, the marketing of your other websites and earnings from your affiliate programs.",

While it is not exactly clear whether Dr. Howser was posting his thoughts on his hard drive or the web, it is unlikely the character even knew what the word \u201cblogger\u201d meant. According to the history books, the word \u201cweblog\u201d was copy written by Jorn Barger in 1997. A list of others followed him in creating their own versions of the original weblog.",
            "Although there is not much information on the beginning of the blog, there is a lot of information leading to the fact that the blog phenomenon is growing rapidly and is not likely to downsize anytime soon. Everyone is blogging these days. With sites offering free blog space, why wouldn\u2019t they? Everyone wants a chance and a forum to express their thoughts, and a blog allows them to do just that. Expression is one of the most precious traits and it should be practiced often. With that being said, you are probably wondering what a blog is, if you don\u2019t already know.",
            "A blog, which is actually short for a weblog, is a lot like an online journal. It is a personal website (or posting space) that is updated frequently. With each posting, the blog is essentially updated. Blogs can include anything the blogger wants it to include. You can write about personal experiences, political views, gossip, books, television, or music. There are really no limits on what you can write about on your own blog. Today\u2019s blogs are allowing bloggers to post photos or little profiles telling their readers more about themselves. Many blogs are so popular that readers will visit them each day in order to see what is new in the blogger\u2019s life. These readers may or may not personally know the blogger, which makes the phenomenon that much more interesting and unexplainable.",
            "The most notable thing about a blog is that it is the first online journal type that offers a place for reader comments. These comments can be helpful to the blog and draw interest to it, or they can be useless. Some advertisers are using blogs today to get their website link or product information out to more people. This can be annoying to bloggers, but the fact is that the advertisers are using other people\u2019s blogs to advertise for free. Although it is annoying, you have to admit, it is a pretty smart idea on the advertising side of things.",
            "It is assumed that blogs are so popular for two main reasons. The first reason is simply because everyone wants to be heard. By posting your opinions, views, or experiences on the web, you are essentially being heard by anyone who reads your post. With more and more people reading blogs, you can count on more and more people reading yours as well. Expressing your opinions allows you to be free from any stress they may cause when you keep them inside. A blog is a socially safe way to express your views without having to worry too much about a reaction from someone else.",
            "The other main reason the blog is so popular is because due to amazing blogging software, it is so simple to do. When personal websites came onto the scene, everyone wanted one. The problem was that the good ones were very difficult to construct unless you had programming experience. Many people hired professionals to create their personal spaces. Blogs on the other hand, are very easy to create. Software allows you to post your thoughts in a typing box and the system automatically updates itself when you are done. It could not be any easier. Because of these two reasons, people absolutely love blogs. They love to post on their own blog and they love to read other blogs. The phenomenon is one that is so well loved it will likely continue to grow and grow."

They are wrong! Blog can generate you the same amount of money if not more compared to any other website. Now im talking about PPC (Pay per click) sorces of revenue such as google adsense here.",
            "The main problem I have noticed is that people tend to concentrate on wider markets. If you are running a personal diary kind of blog, the chances are that there are thousands of similar blogs around. The more competition you have, the harder it will be for you to make some cash. Instead try concentrating on smaller markets also known as niche markets. Not only it will be easier for you to develop the traffic, the CPC (Cost per click) should also be higher due to advertisers demand exceeding publishers supply.",
            "Secondly you need to have a unique selling point. You need to give your readers something that nobody else does. This should really help you get returning visitors.",
            "Finally it\u2019s the ads themselves. You should channel your ads. This way you will be able to measure your ad block\u2019s performance. One of the most important things is to experiment. Try different ad formats, colours and positioning. Run your setup for a few weeks, note the performance and try something different. Even if you think you have found the optimum ad setup keep on trying to improve it. In most cases you can always tweak something to make your ad performance better.",

I haven\u2019t even explained why I have this blog thing. I can\u2019t really jump into getting traffic to your blog without explaining why I have a blog and why you should have one too; now can I?",
            "Let\u2019s go back to my history. I \u201cmade it\u201d online without many of the tools you see me offering today. I had no products. I had no copywriting ability. My search engine ranking data was my key to my original success on the Internet. I would simply create high ranking web-sites for some market and sell the traffic from those sites directly to those who did have copywriiting ability and products. Obviously I no longer recommend that. Having your own product and copywriting ability are both multipliers to knowing how to get traffic. Now-a-days I focus on all three aspects of your Internet business and recommend that you do the same.",

            "1. Yahoo",
            "2. Google",
            "3. MSN (Microsoft)",

            "Now; let\u2019s take a jump here. What do those three sites sell? Ok; take a minute on this one. There will be a test.",
            "That\u2019s right. They sell traffic (or they mostly sell traffic\u2026 Yahoo and MSN are a tiny bit more diverse than that).  Now isn\u2019t that interesting\u2026 The richest man in the world\u2026 who go that way by selling software\u2026 now wants to sell traffic.",
            "OK; that was a diversion. We\u2019ll come back to that later. What I wanted to tell you about was my experience selling traffic (which is still the largest part of my business). I made a mistake. I sold traffic anonymously under corporate names. None of my traffic customers know who I am. They just buy traffic from XYZ Corporation because it converts to sales for them. XYZ Corporation has no personality. In fact, it\u2019s fully automated and most of my customers seem to like it that way.",
            "I tried to change that a couple of years ago. I started sending them emails teaching how they could get the most out of my traffic service. I was too late. They didn\u2019t know me and they didn\u2019t want to hear from me.",
            "Then I tried one last attempt (I\u2019m glad I did) by offering them a special on traffic that month. I think I did a two for one deal or something like that. Over 25% of my customers bought a new campaign that day. I made over $60,000 in one day with that one email. I thought that was cool! I still do. I can write a single email and make thousands of dollars in a single day. I think a lot of marketers like that.",
            "The power of your customer list is incredible! If you can convert 2% of strangers into customers with a sales page, you can convert 25% of your existing customers into customers of another product with that same sales page. That\u2019s powerful!",
            "I tried it with another product. It was a good product. It was mine. It was the search engine research itself that lead to the traffic those customers were buying. In effect, I was offering to teach them how to generate the same traffic that I was selling to them. It flopped miserably. No-one bought. I tried several other products. Nothing. Why?",
            "Some of the responses told me right away. Even though I was writing under the company name, they didn\u2019t know me. I\u2019ll repeat that. They didn\u2019t know me. They knew my company. They knew that my company delivered great converting traffic, but they simply didn\u2019t know me. An endorsement of one company by another isn\u2019t very powerful. It isn\u2019t nearly as powerful as an endorsement by an individual.",
            "So, I went on to do the Freedom Events. You know how they went. Based on the endorsement of a few well-known Internet marketers, they sold out. Lesson learned. To get that 25% number, you need one of the following:",
            "1. To be marketing to your customers as a company and selling a special offer on the product of your company that your customers already know about.",
            "2. To be marketing to your customers as a person and selling a special offer on any product that you personally endorse\u2026 and have never given a bad endorsement on a product to your customers before.",
            "I wanted to do the latter with my own customers\u2026 not those of another Internet marketer.",
            "What is the best way to do that? As I look around, a blog is the absolute perfect vehicle for that. As I sell products (and cross-promote them on the owner\u2019s pages), I also promote this blog. I do it very early in the process. It is mentioned on the owner\u2019s page and is also mentioned in the very first email most people get after purchasing one of my products.",
            "They buy the product from a stranger, but I introduce myself as the creator of that product very early by pointing them (you) at this blog.",
            "Then, I don\u2019t hide the blog behind some corporate image. You do buy my products from a corporation, but do you even know the name of that corporation? Who cares what it is called? I want you to get to know me. That\u2019s the purpose of this blog.",
            "Now some folks are finding this blog before they purchase one of my products. That\u2019s OK too. Some people buy a product based on the sales page. Some buy because they know the author never produces junk. Some have a combination of those reasons.",
            "OK; so\u2026 yes\u2026 you should have a blog. I suggest that you create your blog between your 3rd and 4th product in your primary market. That\u2019s when I created this blog. That is also when you want to start cross-promoting your 3 or 4 products on their owner\u2019s pages.",
            "Here are some other things that I think are important:",
            "1. Register your name for the domain for your blog.",
            "2. Put your name at the top, not some cutesy blog name.",
            "3. Share of yourself. Do not post to your blog like you are a customer service rep answering the phone for a large company\u2026 never revealing anything of yourself\u2026 only the corporate script. Chat with your customers like they are dear friends. Don\u2019t give out your home address or phone number, but within the context of the blog\u2026 what are you afraid of? Let your blog readers get to know you.",
            "4. Post often. People can get into the habit of doing something daily or hourly very easily. It is much more difficult to get into a weekly or monthly habit. Post at least daily so your blog readers can get into a daily habit of reading what you have to say.",
            "5. Don\u2019t worry about giving away secrets of your products. That\u2019s one reason I only sell software, video and mentoring products right now. It\u2019s simply not possible to accidently give away too much in text on your blog. Software and video are both more robust mediums than text. I can explain in words all day long how to do something\u2026 it will still be useful to buy the software to automate that task and/or buy the video to actually see how it all works.",
            "6. Get a subcribe link up on your blog (and all of your content sites). Some people will want to follow your blog, but won\u2019t remember. You need to give them a way to allow you to send them reminders when you post. This will dramatically increase your number of repeat visitors over time.",
            "OK; I think that answers the question about why I have a blog and why you should too\u2026 and how you should set it up. Now, I can jump into the specific ways to get traffic to a blog that only exist for blogs\u2026 not other types of sites. I\u2019ll do that in a future post.",
            "For now, go register your name and get Wordpress installed on that domain. Get your subscribe link up. Write an article and submit it to your blog\u2026 and then submit it via Artemis Pro with your blog mentioned in the resource box of your article. That\u2019s how I started just a little over two months ago and as of today\u2026 I\u2019m almost in the top 10,000 most visited sites on the Internet. See if you can beat me in the next couple of months."

RSS (usually referred to as Really Simple Syndication) is a means to publish regular updates to web content. The content itself is known as the feed.

There are many reasons to track the visitors that read your blog. Understanding who visits you blog will help you know what your readers are looking for. Successful blogging starts with interested writing and will appeal to your readers. Another reason you might want to keep track of the visitors that come to your site is to increase traffic. This is especially important for blogs that are for companies. Companies can use their blog for inexpensive advertising. Knowing who visits the blog site will help a company understand if they are reaching their target audience for their services or products.",
            "A blog hit counter is one way to keep track of the amount of visitors that read your blog. Blog hit counters are usually small boxes at the very end of a web page that updates a number every time your site is hit. Some blog hit counters can give site owners site statistics, reports and graphs to illustrate blog activity. These counters can also show you where your readers are finding your site. If your blog hosting site does not offer a blog hit counter feature, one can easily be downloaded or added to your page from another site. There are many free sites that offer counters for blog pages. Blog writers can register on the hit counter site, download and install directly into the blog template. This will give an accurate count of how many visitors you have to your blog. If you are not worried about keywords or details information about your readers, then a blog hit counter is the easiest way to track your readership.",
            "If you want more advanced blog features, then you can add tracking options to your blog. There are several ways you can track your readers. One is by keywords and the other is a visitor tracker. Keyword trackers are ideal for those who need to know what keywords people are using to locate a blog. This could be important for businesses that need to reach potential consumers. A good keyword tracker can also help you organize your blog site to determine which keywords are most popular with readers. It can also help get your site listed on search engines. Keyword trackers can be downloaded for free in many cases. If your site relies heavily on readers, then a keyword tracker could be a good choice.",
            "A visitor tracker works much the same way as a keyword tracker. The difference, however, is that a visitor tracker will provide you with information statistics about your blog visitors. Usually, this information is given in easy to understand graphs and tables. If you need to see where your visitors are coming from, then a visitor tracker can be quite beneficial. It is a little more sophisticated than a hit counter, but works about the same way. When a visitor enters your blog site, their information is saved onto the visitor tracker. When you are ready, you can log in and see exactly who your visitors are. Many times not only are you able to see the statistics on your readers, but you can also see reports for current visitors and those that have visited the site in the past.",
            "One other way that a blog writer can keep track of their readers is to include a comment section at the end of your blog page. Not all visitors will want to leave a comment, but this is a good way to gain feedback about your site. You will better understand the type of readers that frequent your site, but also understand the kind of content that they want to read."
